https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6goNzXrmFs,Song,230,Wanderers   a short film by Erik Wernquist,"Taken and promoted with permission from Erik Wernquist  For more information and stills gallery, please turn to: erikwernquist.com/wanderers (Just in case my website runs slow, here is a link to an imgur album version of the gallery: imgur.com/a/Ur5dP) Wanderers is a vision of humanity's expansion into the Solar System, based on scientific ideas and concepts of what our future in space might look like, if it ever happens. The locations depicted in the film are digital recreations of actual places in the Solar System, built from real photos and map data where available. Without any apparent story, other than what you may fill in by yourself, the idea with the film is primarily to show a glimpse of the fantastic and beautiful nature that surrounds us on our neighboring worlds - and above all, how it might appear to us if we were there.

Oh could I be the sky on the fourth of July?  “Well you do enough talk My little hawk, why do you cry? Tell me what did you learn from the Tillamook burn? Or the Fourth of July? We’re all gonna die.”  Sitting at the bed with the halo at your head Was it all a disguise, like Junior High Where everything was fiction, future, and prediction Now where am I? My fading supply  “Did you get enough love, my little dove Why do you cry? And I’m sorry I left, but it was for the best Though it never felt right My little Versailles.”  The hospital asked should the body be cast Before I say goodbye, my star in the sky Such a funny thought to wrap you up in cloth Do you find it all right, my dragonfly?  “Shall we look at the moon, my little loon Why do you cry? Make the most of your life, while it is rife While it is light  Well you do enough talk My little hawk, why do you cry? Tell me what did you learn from the Tillamook burn? Or the Fourth of July? We’re all gonna die.”",Sufjan Stevens

Also I dropped 70$ on a new video editor, and it's quite snazzy, so I hope you like the new look (I'm still figuring out some things lol) OvO  Psst, did you catch that Bonetrousle preview at the end?

How'd I ever get so lost Everybody out there on the job, but not me oh no How'd I ever get so indiscreet, how'd I ever get so freakly Everybody out there on a leash But not me  Oh  I know I got no choice, got no choice, but to love myself I know I got no choice, got no choice, but to love myself God knows, you got no choice, got no choice, but to love yourself God knows, I got no choice, got no choice, got no choice  How'd I ever get so off my rocks?

"" The Fire""  chronicles a post-apocalyptic death march set in 1945 during the final stages of World War II in Europe. After a cataclysmic event renders the war futile, a paramilitary splinter group -- led by a Kurtz-like figure known as The Commodore -- forces the transfer of young men who will be used as labor...and food. The last survivor of the march receives a mysterious White Box which holds the key to survival. - Rik",

But without him Though you move you're getting no-where  Tell me Who is in your heart now When Leonard Cohen is singing "" Hallelujah"" ? Who is in your heart now? All your friends and foes they thought they knew ya But look who's in your heart now You scared yourself you are all of a doodah  Oh you gotta hold on to love Oh you'd better hold on to love  Have you ever found something That you didn't even know you're looking for? An answer Though you didn't hear the question  When the plain is shaking violently You wonder will the sky change into heaven And if all fails Who is in your last thought then?",

I never knew why, and you didn't care when It closed every door, and washed away no sin And I promised you, like you promised me But those vows we made, fucked it up for free.  You made a fool out of me and took the skin off my back running So don't breathe when I talk, cos you haven't been spoken to I've got a gun for a mouth and a bullet with your name on it But a trigger for a heart bleeding blood from an empty pocket.

Introducing a reimagined version of one of the most climactic events in the video game history, Time's End. Rozen's new EP weaves a tale of suspense as Clock Town's last hour approaches. Meanwhile, two lovers are reunited and savor their last moments together. Will they make it to the light of day or will the Moon descend upon them? Will the Hero of Time be able to rescue the town from its terrible fate?   PART I. THE PREDICAMENT OF THE FOUR  The EP's dark first movement, released on February 22nd, evokes a powerful mixture of hope and dread as Link calls upon the four giants with the Oath to Order. Nintendo Life calls the track "" an impressive orchestral performance""  and "" a wonderful four and a half minutes.""  Featuring the melancholy vocals of the Audire Soundtrack Choir plus contributions from several other soloists, it's an experience no Majora's Mask fan should miss.  PART II. WE SHALL GREET THE MORNING...TOGETHER  Part II introduces new artist Reven into the fold as she and Rozen tackle the more sensitive side of Majora's Mask. A contrast to the first half, the sweeping melodies of Part II dwell on the heart-wrenching scene of Kafei's return to Anju and their decision to stay in Clock Town no matter the outcome. Fans of the game will recognize snippets of several themes from the series as the piece builds to its awaited conclusion: the end of the world...or the dawn of a new day.  I.

When Link and Tatl come across a carving of herself, Tael and Skull Kid out on Termina Field Tatl recalls how she and her brother met the Skull Kid. This piece represents the memories that Tatl, Tael and Skull Kid shared together. Everything from the lonely and rainy night they meet until the moment Skull Kid loses his sanity to Majora's Mask is represented in this piece.  I hope you enjoy! :D",

GUNSHIP has been described as a neon soaked, late night, sonic getaway drive, dripping with analog synthesizers, cinematic vocals and cyberpunk values, all exploding from the front cover of a dusty plastic VHS case which has lain forgotten since 1984.  Lyrics:  Peace at last The abyss laughs when I tell it I'm ready  Steal the rhythm out from my heart Your bloody hands will make a perfect start Black sun on the horizon Turning tricks to tear our senses apart...  ...And I like it  It's just a little frightening To lose everything at once  Steal the rhythm out from my heart Your bloody hands will make a perfect start Black sun on the horizon Turning tricks to tear our senses apart...  ...And I like it  Into the sun all memory return Spirit bombs explode Are you ready to know everything  Believe it, believe it, we will become one Let it go with your soul  Steal the rhythm out from my heart Steal the rhythm out from my heart",

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3gw0iD5y0Q,Song,251,Delta Heavy - Punish My Love (Official Video),"One of the most exciting and diverse UK duos to take their sound transatlantic, Delta Heavy return after the viral success of their last single ‘Ghost’ with the next single from their forthcoming debut album. Whether it’s at 174 bpm or switching it down a notch for the kind of sub-filled, bouncy records which have made them so notorious across the club circuit, this next output from Delta Heavy perfectly merges two opposite ends of the spectrum. And this will stand as a resounding part of their discography; that’s both on the radio airwaves and from the speakers of venues globally.  ‘Punish my Love’ is pumped up by a chiseled future house groove, juxtaposing euphoric steel pans and an incessantly hooky vocal with playful, elastic bass line.  On the flipside, we’re presented with a vastly different drum and bass mix recalling their trademark sound. Jungle influenced drums, snarling and switching bass lines and a rave piano melody put an aggressive, club-ready spin on the original.  http://vevo.ly/pgeWRz  #DeltaHeavy #PunishMyLove #Vevo",

Her first title song "" Awoo""  is by Primary. It delivers a cute, naughty message that she's not as quiet as she seems, and that she can win anyone's heart if she really puts her mind to it. It will be fun to listen to the confident and ambitious lyrics like "" I flirt with you""  and "" You fall for me"" .  ▶1theK FB  : http://www.facebook.com/1theK ▶1theK TW : https://twitter.com/1theK ▶1theK G+ : https://plus.google.com/+1theK  魅惑的な音色の持ち主、キム・イェリムが、1年5ヶ月ぶりに三枚目のミニアルバム『Simple Mind』でカムバックする。  タイトル曲「Awoo」は、プライマリが作詞・作曲した曲で、普段は大人しいが、その気になれば男を誘惑する女になれるというずる賢い内容を盛り込んでいる。‘私はあなたを誘惑する’、‘君は私に嵌って’など大胆でストレートな歌詞が印象的だ。  매혹적인 음색의 소유자 김예림이 1년 5개월 만에 세 번째 미니앨범 [Simple Mind]으로 컴백한다.  첫 번째 타이틀곡 'Awoo'는 프라이머리가 작사, 작곡한 노래로 평소에는 조용하지만 마음만 먹으면 여우로 변해 남자를 유혹할 수 있다는 앙큼한 내용을 담고 있다. '난 너를 꼬셔', '넌 내게 꽂혀' 등 발칙하고 당돌한 가사가 인상적이다.",

That would be funny if it weren't so sad Well you have been replaced I don't need anyone now When I delete you maybe I'll stop feeling so bad  Go make some new disaster That's what I'm counting on You're someone else's problem Now I only want you gone Now I only want you... gone  Used: Spitfire Albion, Percussion, Solo Strings & Harp, Cinematic Strings 2, Sonokinetic Vivace, Project Sam True Strike & Symphobia II, Cinesamples Piano in Blue, CineSnares, CineBrass, CineBrass Pro, HollyWoodwinds & VOXOs, Sample Modelling French Horn & Tuba, 8dio Requiem Pro, My Voice",

Some songs will show up on Spotify (and many other sites) in a couple of hours. I've been busy working to get all my Undertale remixes on there first, and more will show up over there quite soon, so dun worry if your favorite remix isn't on there yet o3o  I was very surprised no one else remixed Bonetrousle and Megalovania together in an epic remix, and I decided to solve the problem. So here you go, a remix masterpiece that took two weeks of working non-stop (and I'm working on a big project atm too, so that's why this remix took longer than usual) OvO  This song is one of the most technical remixes I've ever written, as I was trying to practice going from two extremities (Very hard tech to light orchestral) and also practice using various transitions throughout the entire piece. I was trying to see how far my skills could go, and I hope you enjoy! OwO  Also Tokyovania's in there, along with a short Cider vocal cameo at 3:11.

The Blizzcon Song Contest Winning Entry 2011!!! Though you've only heard a snippet before, this is the real deal. Unfortunately, due to Blizzard's rules, the entire song is under two minutes long. However, this song more than makes up for the lack of space!  PvP follows my adventures through both life in the world of Azeroth and my own life as well. Whether it's a beautiful Night Elf Rogue, trapped in a tower in Tol Barad or whether it's a girl, out of my reach, this song is about love AND my love for World of Warcraft. I always said I'd make a song chronicling my rise from 1-85 and this is as good as it's going to get!  Please enjoy the 1st place winning entry from Blizzard's Song Contest 2011!   Lyrics: This is my war song all for you I just do not know what to do I keep on coming back it's true At 10 I knew my place was here So leave your doubts and have no fear The righteous path is clear  Pay me no heed I'm about to cause a shakeup Why won't you just wake up Why can't you just take up Arms to defend yourself against me? Dashing young rogues can't be helped when consecrated I still stand elated Even when berated Wish you could just see what I see The gates have opened once again A winter valley, summer sand And all my friends, they tell me  Yeah, you got class Yeah, you got style How will you make it at 85? This world's a battleground You're lucky, even now, to be alive From the ruins to the flag I'll take it back I'll strike you down I'll strike you down  Under-geared everywhere I look around me Gnomes can still astound me Trying to confound me We don't have this problem, but you do Excuse me miss, but I'd like to cash my honor Thought I was a goner Should have done a runner But I still stood and fought for you  From the ruins to the flag I'll take it back I'll strike you down I'll strike you down  Tol Barad It ain't so bad Surrounded by my friends Brave the weather Fight the storm Stay together Live once more Overpowered, my desire Is to meet you in that spire I'm on fire, can't cool down, oh can't you see? It means too much to me My life is PVP",

The album was written during the recording of By the Way, and is widely regarded as his most accessible work, featuring a mix of guitar-driven alternative rock, folk ballads, and electronica. Frusciante has stated that this was his most expensive album to date, costing around $150,000 to produce.  Flea plays a double bass on "" The Slaughter"" , the closing track of the album. All tracks were written by John Frusciante and the majority of the vocal work is performed by him.  Frusciante also made acoustic and demo versions of these tracks available to fans through his official site, now only a blog, as an alternative to the highly produced sound of the record. A promo version of the album was also made, with the tracks "" Omission"" , "" Song to Sing When I'm Lonely"" , and "" Failure 33 Object"" .  The album reached number 191 on the Billboard 200 and #11 on Heatseekers.  On the vinyl release of the album the words "" One step away""  were inscribed on side A, "" There's riddles in the shadows""  on side B, "" A hint of sadness""  on side C, and '"" What they least suspect is coming next""  on side D.

I mean talent wise his skill was incomparable To anything that I've seen so I just ponder and watch I just look on and really didn't want it to stop tracks that he laid paid for the train in my thoughts I patiently wait thinking bout this man and his past Did he rock a million shows make a hundred thousand in cash With a few platinum plaques at his pad outside of reno Or did he fall deep inside of a new casino These are questions that I pose when I ponder On the chance of me like 20 years down the road when I am half of me Will I fall under the same fate or direction? Lessons that I've learned when I burn through my conceptions  [Hook x2] Its just a cold night, im chilling in my city I got the whole night, nobodies gonna get me I hear the key notes dancing and I know it Welcome to the mind of a jazz city poet  [Verse 2] I was told that if you're blessed with a gift the most selfish Thing you could do is pretend that it didn't exist So I take drums that hit, with a jazzy riff when I spit My moms flipped her script when I told her about my gigs but its cool, she knew that I was driven at twenty two now its coming full circle, kicking it back to you Graduated school with a new point of a vengeance Farewell to my fears I will stay clear of your venom Stumbled on the serum, chillin with nothing left Feelings in my chest like I'm ripping it through a vest And im taking it to the next step, kill the regret Any mistakes that I made is now a part of my past Im taking it home, can't stop, leave it alone Part of myself yells to keep keeping it going The lights dim down again the Saxophone starts to play I start to picture everything, I wish I could say  [Hook x2] Its just a cold night, im chilling in my city I got the whole night, nobodies gonna get me I hear the key notes dancing and I know it Welcome to the mind of a jazz city poet  [Verse 3] I lounge back while I relapse and I might go The whole track starts to relax and I write slow Back to the tempo pondering music When I would think about the future with songs That'll get me through it I'm good deal it if I'm misunderstood Hope my future children see, take it and they achieve Poppa Followed Christ, poppa was in love Poppa had dreams but Poppa will never be A puppet used to poison the passionate plus irrelevant Portraits on a beat, taking a part of me I rather take a seat in a room full of my heroes Their hair turning grey, wearing their cowl and cape I just listen, taking mental notes within my vision The longer conversation im pondering my condition As a writer, the lights start to flicker on its brighter As passion starts to leave I make a promise to write her  [Hook x2] Its just a cold night, im chilling in my city I got the whole night, nobodies gonna get me I hear the key notes dancing and I know it Welcome to the mind of a jazz city poet",

No, no, no, we just keep going Write a new song, craft another great poem And then you broadcast, shoot it through they hard glass Hook 'em with the single then you hit 'em with the star clash Know what that is? That's your best move Make the crowd roar, get the one, two, three, count Pin they shoulders to the mat now Raise your title to the ceiling, really watch 'em clap loud Now they ring the bell, hatin' cause you feeling well Climbing to my citadel, shooting all my sentinels—BOOM!  (Pre-chorus) I said BOOM! (x2)  (Chorus) We taking off, we driving it all night We'll be flying away We taking off, we driving it all night We'll be flying away  (Verse 2) I like to paint thoughts, in a song form They like to twist words, make me conform Make me feel like I am trapped up in a box Every single that I drop, it ain't ever gonna stop, no! 'Cause I'm lovin all the energy Call it what you will, but I call it versatility I really like my jazz and I dig rock too I dig a Rocky Johnson and Fatu Independent but I'm sent to intervent it In the main event I win it like a Undertaker finish And I got to take a minute, words is my melody Write another verse just to work through telepathy I fell before so I remember how that feel like Don't it feel like you was dreaming, is this real life? This is real as a knife that'll cut my mic off And we all love to glow so turn the lights off—HEY!  (Pre-chorus) I said HEY! (x2)  [Chorus]  (Verse 3) We on verse 3, you get the song yet? You want the highly profound with the soul flip? In a bold step I will fold any old texts Claiming they a legend but they hidden just like Olmec! Yeah, we bringing life to the radio Take it to the station to the pavement just to play me though They call it underground, we call it underrated A bunch of talented people who really could've made it But that's the fabric in the blanket of our culture Cop a couple Lamborghini's then you're over I copped my own ship, I fly it to the moon I get to see the world and maybe see ya soon So we can grip the mic and lighten up the dance floor Have 'em throw they arms around until we see they hands sore Now they ring the bell, hatin' 'cause you feeling well Climbing to my citadel, shooting all my sentinels—BOOM!

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xCrTl0Hnc5E,Song,235,Vessel & Prime - Let It Go [2016],"First song off the upcoming Vessel & Prime Project by producer Thomas Prime and rapper Vessel.  https://www.facebook.com/ThomasPrimeMusic / https://www.Soundcloud.com/ThomasPrime / https://www.twitter.com/ThomasPrime  Well I'm back from my hiatus!  Sorry it was longer than I hoped.  Good news is I'm back so things at CCR are in full swing ready for our relaunch / rebrand. My absence made me realise how many of you guys on YT are isolated from the community on my FB, Twitter, Mixlr..etc so be sure to follow my accounts below BUT I promise I'll be WAY more active on here and will post more updates..etc  Compilation series launches real soon too.....  For now enjoy this song and please drop a comment below I've missed you guys!!  ► http://facebook.com/bob42jh ► http://twitter.com/bob42jh ► http://mixlr.com/bob42jh  LYRICS:  Verse 1 Going nowhere fast like a whip on some bricks. I apologize for problems that I couldn't fix. You're the reason why I believe angels exist. Always shoot for the stars, but don't be afraid If you miss. Chronic blunts and bong rips, I'm faded as shit. Conversation like a war zone, those are dangerous lips. Short on breath been busy chasing the wind. But still keep an ear open for the snakes when they hiss. Is this punishment? At the bottom I'm a sunken ship. I just keep it real in my music and hope they Fuck with it. Falling out with friends again, hollowed out dead within. Switch it up, change of pace, peel the flesh, change of skin. You know. If they hold you back then learn to let go. Not everything is meant to be some doors are better left closed. It's like everywhere I go, another fork in the road. I just hope the right path is chose, but y'all don't hear me though.  Verse 2 Picking scabs for the sake of scars. Strip me down to naked art. The irony in being gentle when you go to break a heart. Your body motion says a lot, but it's like these eyes are def. I'm only speaking truth when I say I wanna lay in bed. Inside your head it's hard to read. Anxiety it's hard to breathe. But when I look into your eyes it's like I hit the lottery. Two of a kind but not a common breed. You probably think I'm kicking game but every word is honesty. Free as a Bird in a cage, complain and push em away. A world full of people searching for some personal space. The world works in mysterious ways. Like, Dark times, sunshine could you spare a few rays? I swear. times a thief that leaves nothing behind. That's why I document my life in these rhymes. Its all over in the blink of an eye, so I appreciate every single moment that keeps passing me by. I'm more than satisfied.",

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mA-0LF4gglg,Song,264,Rozen & Jose Madrid - Saria's Elegy (From Ocarina of Time),"Discover a new way of experiencing The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time - through the thoughts of Link. In this huge collaboration between G.A.N.G. Award-nominee composer Rozen (www.rozen.audio) and singer/songwriter Jose Madrid (www.facebook.com/josemadridmusic), the duo decided to explore the legendary game by Nintendo through the eyes of the silent hero, Link.  “Saria’s Elegy”, written by Jose Madrid and arranged by Rozen, is a song that explores the thoughts of a recently unfrozen Hero of Time, who's discovered the truth about his age, and rushes back to the woods in order to find the one special to his heart. Will she remember him after all this years?  Inspired by “Saria’s Song” by Koji Kondo, “Saria’s Elegy” invites the listener to embark on a more personal journey through the voice and deep songwriting of Jose Madrid, and the lustrous orchestral arrangements of Rozen.

Everything I’ve known In the wind turns colder  As I walk alone I just think about her And these woods turned home Can’t perceive that I’m hurt  CHORUS She meant the world to me But now she is gone and free, I feel Will she come around? If all of my memories could whisper no sound In silence I’ll drown  But she was a friend to me And sadly, that’s all I need to heal Will she be around? If all of my memories could ask her aloud Do you remember me? Now  Darkness let me glow Let my courage be heard As the tales that once were told Turn to life and take its toll  CHORUS She meant the world to me But now she is gone and free, I feel Will she come around? If all of my memories could whisper no sound In silence I’ll drown  But she was a friend to me And sadly, that’s all I need to heal Will she be around? If all of my memories could ask her aloud Do you remember me? Now  How can she see from above And feel all the things that I love I promise this time I won’t leave, I’ll stay To see her again some day  CHORUS She was a friend to me And sadly, that’s all I need to heal Will she be around? If all of my memories could ask her aloud Do you remember me?    TRACKLIST AND CREDITS __________________________  01.

Fuck Everything lyrics  Yeah yeah yeah. Fuck Everything, Fuck it all down to hell Fuck everything, Fuck it all down, all down to hell  You know sometimes life don't seem fair and it feels like... Nothing seems to go your way That’s cause it’s not there, it never goes your way and with a population of billions of people it’s selfish to think that life would ever go your own specific way But true sometimes it all becomes too much and you feel like… Punching a thousand fuckwits in the head But of course you’re not gonna do that, cause you’re a civilised human being so you ain’t got nothing, left to say, but  Fuck Everything, Fuck it all down to hell Fuck everything, Fuck it all down, all down to hell  You know sometimes the pressure of life pushes down on you and it feels like… You can’t even breathe But if it makes you feel any better, nothing you’ll ever do in life is gonna make a difference anyway You see we’re all just specks in an ever expanding universe that we can’t comprehend Cause of the size of our tiny brains And in a million years, we’ll all be dust and there won’t be a tract of our existence so what’s the point in worrying, it’s more fun to say  Fuck Everything, Fuck it all down to hell Fuck everything, Fuck it all down to hell Fuck Everything, Fuck it in its stupid ass Fuck everything, Fuck it all down, all down to hell  Now I know most of y’all don’t agree, with my bleak outlook on life, but I say… It’s the thing that sets me free Cause I don’t give a shit what you think of me, no I don’t give any shits that’s right I aint got any shits to give Now i’m not saying you can’t go out and live a fantastic life you totally can, you just need to remember… You’re not the centre of the fucking universe And I want to celebrate, the absolute insignificance of our existence by coming together, coming together to say  Fuck Everything, Fuck it all down to hell Fuck everything, Fuck it all down to hell Fuck Everything, Fuck it in its stupid ass Fuck everything, Fuck it all down, all down to hell Fuck Everything, Fuck it all down to hell Fuck everything, Fuck it all down to hell Fuck Everything, Fuck it with a thousand dirty dicks Fuck everything, Fuck it all down, all down to hell",

Hammock is an American two-member post-rock band from Nashville, Tennessee. With music created in between production and songwriting projects over the course of two years, Hammock combines live instrumentation, electronic beats, and droning guitar into atmospheric music similar in style to the work of Boards of Canada, Explosions in the Sky, and Stars of the Lid.  Lyrics:  Every time you wake up, Too gone to see.  Every time you come down, So far from me.  Next time when you wake up, You're lost at sea.  I just watch you sink down, And fade away from me.  Where do you go, When the life slips from your eyes?  I'll never know, Why you smiled and waved goodbye.  Where do you go, When the life slips from your eyes?  I'll never know, Why you smiled and waved goodbye.",

Was looking forward to Being important but I’m not important yet  If you put this scene on a movie screen Is it called a happy end? If the work gets me where I’m supposed to be Will I know I’ve made it then?  It’s so hard Can we skip to the good part?  If there’s a good part then I hope it’s not far ‘cause I thought it’d be today  I napped on campus and I smoked at dances But it didn’t feel so great  If you put this scene on a movie screen Is it called a happy end? If the work gets me where I’m supposed to be Will I know I’ve made it then?  It’s so hard So can we skip to the good part? So can we skip to the good part?

There's a song in my ear I've been hearing for years Somehow it always appears  (whistling),

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjZy4bymvvk,Song,317,Johannes Brahms - Intermezzo Op. 117 No. 1 in E flat major,"The 3 Intermezzi Op. 117 were composed in 1892 and are among the best-loved and most popular of Brahms' autumnal late piano output. On a smaller and more intimate scale than the surrounding sets of Op. 116, Op. 118 and Op. 119, the composer described these pieces as "" lullabies to my sorrows"" . Here we find Brahms at his most tender and introspective, with only one outburst (in the third Intermezzo) of the characteristic Brahmsian fieryness. The Intermezzi were inspired by a Scottish poem from Herder's Volkslieder, and bear this inscription:  Schlaf sanft mein Kind, schlaf sanft und Schön! Mich dauert's sehr, dich weinen sehn.  Sleep softly my child, sleep softly and well! It hurts my heart to see you weeping.  Piano: Idil Biret  Picture: Winter, Close of Day by George Inness",

Blais, a 31-year-old pianist from Montreal, pairs the melodic pop sensibilities of Yann Tiersen and Chilly Gonzales with the breathtaking technical skill of minimalist composers like Philip Glass and Erik Satie.  Blais grew up in a rural French Catholic town in Quebec, and at age nine began tinkering with his family’s organ. By 16, he was invited by a conservatory to train as a classical pianist. Deep in the throes of teenage rebellion, Blais found the constraints of formal training cumbersome and, after two years of study, he decided to trade the conservatory for a life of world travel.  Blais then spent his 20s living around the world — including stints in Berlin and South America — before finally settling in Montreal where he began to work on his debut album, entitled Il, which will be released on Arts & Crafts on April 8, 2016.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SyzVyIhGxVw,Song,255,Hugh - Go,"Directors: Anna Brooks/Katie Callaghan Producer: Ollie Wright Choreography: Michael Peter Johnson Hair And Makeup: Annie Loach D.O.P: Diana Olifirova Styling: Izzy Brooks  The video was shot & directed by Anna Brooks and Katie Callaghan, a photography and design duo from East London who met whilst studying at Kingston University back in 2008.  On the video’s concept Anna says, “symmetry and reflection are big visual mechanics for us. We wanted to create a transient narrative that flowed between the 4 characters with ‘Little Hugh’ embodying the energy and spirit of Joshua and Izzy. So they literally dance in the shadows of their seniors, share their rhythm, their words, their stage and corridors without ever sharing the same frame.”  Filmed at Hendon High school in North London, Katie adds “colour was also very important. We needed a location that matched the subtle aesthetic and the soft hues of greens and blues across the school's empty changing rooms, corridors, and gymnasium felt quite timeless."" ""   The band set out early this year to scout 'Little Hugh's' who could channel the kind of connective energy that Josh and Izzy share on stage.  Whilst doing the school run for a friend’s kid, Izzy was introduced to 8 year old Zola in the playground after hearing she was a street dancer. “She was so shy she couldn’t actually speak to me, so I thought I’d been introduced to the wrong girl perhaps at first, but then I remember asking her if she danced and she just looked at me and nodded with this firm, unwavering confidence that I was so certain it would work."" ""   Working alongside choreographer Michael Peter Johnson, the dance was built to be an extension of the moves Josh and Izzy perform as part of their live show but lots of the creative process also became led by the ‘Little Hugh’s' who regularly attend a street dance class together in East London.  Izzy says “we asked Pierre and Zola to show us how they danced with their mates at school. We played the track, the four of us formed a circle and they just started cutting shapes and gestured for us to to mirror them. Josh would drop in a move and then we’d all have to follow, the four of us dressed identically playing ‘follow the leader’, it was like they were initiating us back into the playground, it felt incredible.”  http://vevo.ly/R6X15C",

Beware beware of the words I twist I am small but my reach is long And the ravens black against the winter's mist Are whispering the half-man's song  Whispering the half man's song...  The land is a blooming orchard With fruits so juicy and ripe With a clink of a coin loose the lion's loin Play a tune on the half man's pipe  In the arms of a whore I made a promise Sinking deeper into danger every day Cut through all their shit with a brazen wit Molding puppets from their minds of clay  I'm no man of honour Myself is my true king But somewhere deep within me The bells of conscience ring  Beware beware of the words I twist I am small but my reach is long And the ravens black against the winter's mist Are whispering the half-man's song  They're whispering the half man's song... Whispering the half man's song...,

In all the time that we've known each other, we've shot countless music videos together. She is also my DJ (DJ Leen) for my live performances from time to time. It only made sense that we shoot the official music video on our wedding day. The fact that this video is what it is, is exactly why I married the girl in this video. She loves me and my art and she supports me in whatever I embark on. We hope you enjoy watching this video as much as we enjoyed making it!

In the sky of a million stars It flickers, flickers Who cares when someone's time runs out? If a moment is all we are Or quicker, quicker Who cares if one more light goes out? Well I do  The reminders, pull the floor from your feet In the kitchen, one more chair than you need, oh And you're angry, and you should be, it's not fair Just 'cause you can't see it, doesn't mean it, isn't there  If they say Who cares if one more light goes out? In the sky of a million stars It flickers, flickers Who cares when someone's time runs out? If a moment is all we are Or quicker, quicker Who cares if one more light goes out? Well I do  (I do)  Who cares if one more light goes out? In the sky of a million stars It flickers, flickers Who cares when someone's time runs out?

"" It has been incredibly emotional to work on this, and especially to watch it. I feel that by doing it, we not only faced some of our biggest fears, but it enabled us to use our talents to bring some light to people that need it. As we move forward to the Hollywood Bowl show and beyond, I think about the people that connect with the band, outside and inside our circle. This video is a gesture of good will to the people that want that connection.""  - JOE HAHN  "" One More Light was written with the intention of sending love to those who lost someone. We now find ourselves on the receiving end. In memorial events, art, videos, and images, fans all over the world have gravitated towards this song as their declaration of love and support for the band and the memory of our dear friend, Chester.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24bn0qETjI,Song,233,Anna Burch - Asking 4 a Friend [OFFICIAL AUDIO],"Detroit singer/songwriter, Anna Burch, came to Polyvinyl’s attention the same way most valuable discoveries happen. By word of mouth. Fellow Michigan native and longtime Polyvinyl artist, Fred Thomas, sent Burch’s demos to Polyvinyl in the summer of 2017 with a simple note; “This is not a drill. You need to hear this.”  Turns out Thomas was right.  After learning the ins and outs of playing live and recording with various acts over the last several years, Burch found herself accumulating a growing amount of solo material. These songs, full of sincerity and undeniable depth, caught the ears of Collin Dupuis (Angel Olsen, The Black Keys) who mixed the tracks and helped develop the final product into what would become her debut full-length album, set to be released in early 2018.

I feel that any song, new or old, that reminds me of my days playing these games are perfectly suited to put into a "" Zeldawave""  video. If you disagree, that is perfectly fine. I have even made a Zelda-only video if that's what you like. However, please stop reminding me that certain songs "" aren't Zelda""  when to me it doesn't matter at all.

I waited a long time to do this, as I knew it would be a huge undertaking.  I've been documenting my work/progress, and will be uploading an hour long video showing this monster being creating.  In this remix/arrangement, I attempted to tell a story, following Link through Hyrule.  It doesn't play the themes necessarily in the order the player would hear them, but I wanted this order, as the themes flow together very nicely.  Of the 28 tracks I arranged, I have a few personal favorite sections; in no particular order, they're Goron City, Medalion Get, Lost Woods, Forest Temple, Zora's Domain, Lakeside Lab, Kakariko Village and Zelda's Lullaby.  By all means, please tell me your own favorites.  This thing is my baby and I think several pieces of me went into this.  If you liked, please subscribe, as I'm planning on doing (and have already created) many, many more medleys like this one.  More medleys for Zelda are planned (as well as other games I often mention) including Wind Waker, A Link to the Past and possibly Link's Awakening.  🍨 Buy me an ice cream: https://ko-fi.com/rebeccaetripp  Here's a list of all the tracks included in this medley:  Open Treasure Box Spiritual Stone Get/Light Arrows Castle Courtyard Market Lon Lon Ranch/Epona's Song Hyrule Field Goron City Kaepora Gaebora Twinrova Gerudo Valley Ganon's Theme Inside Jabu Jabu's Belly Lake Side Laboratory/Magic Potion Shop Spirit Temple Words of the Deku Tree Forest Temple Temple of Time/Song of Time Chamber of The Sages Zora's Domain Kakariko Village Princess Zeldaís Theme/Zeldaís Lullaby Title Theme/Opening Screen Medallion Get Kokiri Forest Lost Woods/Saria's Song Windmill Hut/Song of Storms Fairy Fountain/The Great Faery Sheik's Theme  Here are some of my other Zelda medleys:  Majora's Mask Epic Orchestral Medley: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Csj2K-jD25Y&list=PLhsnNwoLVWWNhgWEy1zm7_-HqnEg7q3CN Various Town Themes Celtic Medley: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8V2pKFz_F0&list=PLhsnNwoLVWWNhgWEy1zm7_-HqnEg7q3CN Epic Overworld Themes Medley: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pW6l7UKdvBc&list=PLhsnNwoLVWWNhgWEy1zm7_-HqnEg7q3CN Skyward Sword Goddess Songs Medley: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSYPHyBsHpc&list=PLhsnNwoLVWWNhgWEy1zm7_-HqnEg7q3CN  Link to every VGM remix I've ever created (there is an absurdly high number): https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLhsnNwoLVWWON9zRaW-KZKRwBHKeLZ_V7  Link to my FB fan page: https://www.facebook.com/CrystalEchoSound Link to my Twitter: https://twitter.com/EvokeSeagull  Here is my personal website: http://www.crystalechosound.com/",

Lately you’ve been searching for a darker place to hide That’s alright But if you carry on abusing you’ll be robbed from us I refuse to lose another friend to drugs Just come home Don’t let go  If you look into the distance there’s a house upon the hill Guiding like a lighthouse its a place where you’ll be safe to feel our grace Cause we’ve all made mistakes, If you’ve lost your way  I will leave a light on I will leave a light on I will leave a light on I will leave a light on  If you look into the distance there’s a house upon the hill Guiding like a lighthouse It’s a place where you’ll be safe to feel our grace And if you’ve lost you way, if you’ve lost your way  And I know your down and out now but I need you to be brave Hiding from the truth ain’t going to make this all okay I feel your pain; if you don’t feel our grace then you’ve lost your way  And I will leave a light on I will leave a light on Cause I will leave a light on .........",

Lyrics :  Learning comes later, savor the sorrow Were these moments fate or just something borrowed and set to leave? Yearning for greater, I long for tomorrow Stuck in a state of clinging to far roads, they’re tempting me  To see this through new eyes, sun in a high-rise There’s a reason why two lives can feel like they’re Both counterclockwise, but time makes new allies It can ease their minds, and let things fall behind  So take it as a sign, you have both found what you were looking to find Don’t let it all decline, know that you were still made to feel aligned  Learning comes later, savor the sorrow Were these moments fatal, trusting to erode? Yet I believe  The city’s in your skies, the streets have all realized There’s a reason why two lives feel intertwined Hope for a reprise, a sonnet with more lines Alteration finds, and wonder calls to bind  All our time, say that you’ll feel it again When you’re hanging on, while you’re letting go to all you know (All our habits are falling rapids and all you do is step aside) Facing a climb, say that your steel doesn’t bend When you’re hanging on, while you’re letting go to all I’ve shown Watch, we’ll unwind, say that this isn’t the end When you’re hanging on, while you’re letting go  Oh take it as a sign, it is the star to every wandering heart and mind (Don’t say it’s over, call it a clover, I’m never cold and you’re never forward, don’t say it’s over, don’t say that’s all we’ve got)  Take it as a sign, it is a part of every two colors combined (Don’t say it’s over, call it a clover, I’m never cold and you’re never forward, don’t say it’s over, don’t say that's all we’ve got)  Oh take it as a sign, you have both found what you were looking to find (Don’t say it’s over, call it a clover, I’m never cold and you’re never forward, don’t say it’s over, don’t say that's all we’ve got)",

While all pieces were written in 1988, some were written for a staging of Metamorphosis, while others were for a documentary film called The Thin Blue Line directed by Errol Morris. "" Metamorphosis One""  is played in an episode of Battlestar Galactica by Kara "" Starbuck""  Thrace. Within the narrative, her father composed and performed the piece. It is also played in the series finale of Person of Interest, Return 0. "" Metamorphosis Two""  formed the basis of one of the main musical themes in the film The Hours. It is also the song that the American rock band Pearl Jam uses as their introduction music to concerts.", 
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ajaajvK39zQ,Playlist,4794,Pärt: Choral and Organ Music (Full Album),"Tracklist Below: Download via iTunes: https://itunes.apple.com/album/arvo-part-organ-choral-music/id1036814445 Buy CD: http://brilliantclassics.com/articles/p/paert-choral-and-organ-music/ Listen via Spotify: https://open.spotify.com/album/6jkNiHFRR96Oi9GSaELeu9  Arvo Pärt’s music resists the easily achieved peace of much Minimalist music of its time, even if its economy of gesture and expression – the joy taken in apparently simple beauty – has made him one of the iconic composers of our time. Such beauty is not simply achieved, and Pärt has written slowly, again unlike many of his contemporaries, filling each new piece with quiet quirks of harmony and unexpected turns that make them as satisfying to perform as they are to hear.  All the works on this album of music reflecting Pärt’s deep Christian faith derive from the ‘tintinnabuli’ style which he created in the 1970s, in rebellion from an earlier embrace of Modernism. In Cantate Domino (1978), a simple melodic voice embraced by an accompaniment taken from the tonic triad – the bell-like sound inspiring the label. In the Berliner-Messe of 1990 there are certainly many moments of ascetic detachment but these are balanced with a compelling range of emotion: originally written with string parts, the Mass is here performed as it would more commonly be heard in a liturgical context, with organ accompaniment. The organ plays a central role in The Beatitudes (199X): granite slabs of sound come into focus over unyielding pedal notes, the message intensified in the silences. Intensity rises with pitch until the music is torn apart by the organ at the concluding Amen.  Spiegel im Spiegel is a Pärt classic for its ineffable and seemingly inevitable progression, and makes no less haunting an effect than the violin-and-piano original in this arrangement for organ made in 2010. The other organ works are more imposing: Annum per annum, Trivium and Pari intervallo, all making full use of the Klais-restored organ of Leeds Cathedral.  The cathedral’s musicians have made several well-received recordings for Brilliant Classics, of music by Maurice Duruflé (9264), Hendrik Andriessen (94958), Georgi Mushel (9279) and others. Of the Durufle, Gramophone’s reviewer wrote: ‘Leeds Cathedral Choir…bright tone and honest, natural singing deliver very accomplished and satisfying performances. The choir are ably supported by the splendid accompaniments of the Skipton Camerata and organists Benjamin Saunders and Daniel Justin. It’s faithfully captured by the excellent recording… an enjoyable and rewarding two-CD set.’  As follow-up on their successful Duruflé recording (BC 9264) the splendid Leeds Cathedral Choir, conductor Benjamin Saunders and organist Felix Justin present choral and organ music by Arvo Pärt, the iconic Estonian master of New Spirituality. Included are the popular Berliner Messe, the Beatitudes, the complete organ works and Pärt’s most famous work, Spiegel im Spiegel, here played on the organ. Recorded in the spacious and generous acoustics of Leeds Cathedral, also featuring its magnificent organ.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eDCohREvG0,Playlist,4438,Penguin Cafe Orchestra - Union Cafe (1993) [FULL ALBUM HQ].wmv,"[THE BAND] The Penguin Café Orchestra are a British classical ensemble formed in 1974 by Simon Jeffes (a guitar student at the Royal Academy) aiming to play ethnic music with the austerity of Western chamber music and the decadent languor of the café-concerto. The sound of this orchestra is fatuous and elegant, unaffected by the turmoil of modern life. Their music is as abstract as it is concrete: cabaret and ethnic folk elements are injected into baroque and renaissance music skeletons. Old-fashioned, nostalgic, theatrical and lofty, calligraphic but never parodistic, this exercise in revival aims to rebuild an atmosphere (the one of bourgeois families from the end of past century strolling to the city centre on Sundays) more than a sound. Every composition is a synthesis of music from certain period and exotic arrangements.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jXUSxq30hA,Song,401,Lane 8 - Little Voices,"Buy/Stream: https://tnh.lnk.to/LittleVoices TNH Summer Gatherings: http://www.this-never-happened.com/summergatherings/  The response to our This Never Happened tour last year completely blew me away. The shows were among my favorite club experiences ever - and to see you all embrace the concept and make those shows so incredible was one of the proudest moments of my career. I truly feel that we developed a connection with music and each other that needs to be built upon and nurtured.  I've had a little dream of doing a series of extended daytime events since we launched the TNH concept. So, this summer, we are excited to bring TNH back, with a twist, for the Summer Gatherings - three extended daytime parties in three unique locations with an extra focus on positivity, character and atmosphere.  I’ve always felt there’s a special magic that comes together at the best daytime events, so my team and I have been searching high and low for locations that have that unique and positive vibe. I'm really excited to announce the first three - the stunning outdoor Mishawaka Amphitheatre in Colorado, the outdoor courtyard of The Well in Brooklyn and an amazing warehouse space in San Francisco.  Each has its own unique character and vibe, and we’ll be putting in extra touches to make the events even more special.  We’re also changing the format of the events to create a more expanded musical journey. I'll start each of these shows with a 2 hour warmup set - then our special guest Luttrell will take over, before a 3 hour closing set from me.  I also wanted to share some new music as we announce these shows - and Little Voices was made with exactly this kind of show in mind. I've been closing a lot of my sets with this recently, hope you enjoy and hope to see you this summer :)  Love, Daniel  Subscribe: http://po.st/ytlane8music  Follow Lane 8: Website: http://www.lane8music.com Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/lane8music Twitter: https://twitter.com/lane8music Spotify: http://po.st/sLane8 Instagram: http://instagram.com/lane8music SoundCloud: https://soundcloud.com/lane8music",

If I call on every soul in the land, on the moon Tell me if I'll ever know a blessing in disguise  The curse ruled from the underground down by the shore And their hope grew with a hunger to live unlike before And the curse ruled from the underground down by the shore And their hope grew with a hunger to live unlike before",

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ksv_blsfKU,Song,348,Juno's Touch - Constellation Conversation (Music Video),"This is a song I wrote about the past 13 years of my life attending school. It's about graduating high school and beginning something new. It reflects on the past and remembers who I spent it with. I could never quite grasp the idea of graduating. People I'd see everyday for years and years would suddenly just vanish when the last day of school came. Change and closure have always been my best friend and my biggest enemy. This song was my closure. The lyrics are in call and response form. The male voice, me, representing me. The female voice represents those I grew up with, whether they were best friends, or hallway acquaintances.  Authenticity was very important to me with this project. All the extras were people I grew up with and went to high school with. The mystery girl is one of my best friends, who I've known since preschool. The school scenes were filmed at my actual high school. The band scene was filmed at the first venue I ever played at. The home videos are my actual home videos footage. I wanted to recreate the time I had in school, as it was a period of my life I'll never forget.

Project of Ryan Karazija, Low Roar is the incarnation of change, atmosphere, and loneliness after a move from San Francisco, California to Reykjavík, Iceland. His self-titled emotive, twelve song debut chronicles the challenges of starting anew in a foreign land and is an honest depiction of the struggles to acclimate, find work, and support his family in the Icelandic winter. The album's opening lyrics "" I won't wake a wealthy man someday, 'cause the sun don't follow me""  begin to tell Low Roar's story.  Artist: Ryan Karazija Album: Low Roar Year: 2011 Songs: 1.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9E6b3swbnWg,Song,269,Chopin - Nocturne op.9 No.2,"Nocturne in E-flat major, Op. 9, No. 2 Played by Vadim Chaimovich (https://www.youtube.com/vadimchaimovich) FB-Vadim: https://www.facebook.com/vadimchaimovich -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------  Instagram https://www.instagram.com/andrearomanoandrea  Vincent van Gogh painted The Starry Night one year before dying. Chopin composed his popular Nocturne when he was about twenty. it does not matter if you think that it is too late for you or that you still have a lot of time...you have to decide whether you are Chopin or van Gogh.  The idea behind these videos is coming from a research published by the Psychology Department of Berkeley University studying the relation between colors, emotions and how external stimuli are impacting decision making.  The study results demonstrate a strong correlation between faster music in minor tone and the choice from participants of colors from that were saturated, yellower and lighter whereas a slower and minor music produced the opposite pattern (choice of desaturated, darker and bluer colors).  Based on these findings, we wanted to create synesthesia in our videos and trigger more intense and long-lasting emotions in our viewers, get higher audience retention and interaction. We decided to do that by associating drawings from the major painters that were following the scientific findings of this research. The choice of these paintings and the consecutive association with the music is also based on an accurate work that requires significant time and energy.  The analysis of the melodies returned to us a lot of information on how the painting should have been made. We needed a simple blue pattern but with an intrinsic meaning. Something that people could watch for a while without really understand it.  By creating this video I tried to do only one thing which turned to be the most difficult one: make you feel an emotional synesthesia. When hearing the melody, don't you feel that everything is...blue? aren’t you lost in the sky? is your mind going over? It’s not for no reason. it is not only an image, it is not only a melody. It is a trip. You don't feel bored. Its your mind using the notes and the colors to create your own experience.  Most of the videos online with only one image are only music, but not this.  The research behind the perfect combination is the key for the unconscious.  The research: "" Music–color associations are mediated by emotion""  https://www.pnas.org/content/110/22/8836 Stephen E. Palmer, Karen B. Schloss, Zoe Xu, and Lilia R. Prado-León --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  This popular nocturne is in rounded binary form (A, A, B, A, B, A) with coda, C. The A and B sections become increasingly ornamented with each recurrence. The penultimate bar utilizes considerable rhythmic freedom, indicated by the instruction, senza tempo (without tempo). Nocturne in E-flat major opens with a legato melody, mostly played piano, containing graceful upward leaps which becomes increasingly wide as the line unfolds. This melody is heard again three times during the piece. With each repetition, it is varied by ever more elaborate decorative tones and trills. The nocturne also includes a subordinate melody, which is played with rubato.",

''Chopin - Spring Waltz'' is just a pseudonym. Chopin hasn't written this piece. I uploaded this piece when I, just like you, didn't know the truth that this piece is not by Chopin! But... Unfortunately, if I'll change the name of this video to the correct one, other videos with name "" Chopin Spring Waltz""  will rise on top(there's hundreds of them!), so I put this disclaimer on top of description of the most popular video. I truly didn't want to pour misinformation around.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_fuIMye31Gw,Song,945,Erik Satie - Gymnopédies,"Erik Satie - Gymnopédie No.1  Satie was introduced as a "" gymnopedist""  in 1887, shortly before writing his most famous compositions, the Gymnopédies. Later, he also referred to himself as a "" phonometrograph""  or "" phonometrician""  (meaning "" someone who measures (and writes down) sounds"" ) preferring this designation to that of "" musician,""  after having been called "" a clumsy but subtle technician""  in a book on contemporary French composers published in 1911.  Éric Alfred Leslie Satie (French: [eʁik sati];[1] 17 May 1866 – 1 July 1925), who signed his name Erik Satie after 1884, was a French composer and pianist. Satie was an influential artist in the late 19th- and early 20th-century Parisian avant-garde. His work was a precursor to later artistic movements such as minimalism, repetitive music, and the Theatre of the Absurd  Satie was a colourful figure in the early 20th century Parisian avant-garde. He was a precursor to later artistic movements such as minimalism, repetitive music and the Theatre of the Absurd. The Gymnopédies, published in Paris starting in 1888, are three piano compositions written by French composer and pianist, Erik Satie.  Since 1911 he had been on friendly terms with Igor Stravinsky, about whom he would later write articles.Le piège de Méduse (1913) had a unique position in Satie's oeuvre, as it was a stage work conceived and composed seemingly without any collaboration with other artists.Sports et divertissements was a kind of multi-media project, in which Satie provided piano music to drawings made by Charles Martin. The work was composed in 1914, but not published or performed until the early 1920s. The individual pieces are characteristic Satie "" miniatures"" : in all, there are twenty pieces - none over two minutes in length, and some as short as 15 seconds.He got in trouble over an insulting postcard he had written to one of his critics shortly after the premiere of Parade; he was condemned to a week of imprisonment, but was finally released as a result of the (financial) intercession of Winnaretta Singer, Princess Edmond de Polignac.Singer, who had learnt Ancient Greek when she was over 50, had commissioned a work on Socrates in October 1916; this would become his Socrate, which he presented early in 1918 to the Princess.  - Gymmopedie No. 1. - Gnossienne No. 1 - Gnossienne No. 3 -GnossienneNo. 4 - Gnossienne No. 2  Édouard Cortès's paintings.", 
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ewgvSvm_EwQ,Playlist,1592,"Debussy, Satie, Faure, Ravel, Saint Saens","This was a project required to be bellow 30 minutes in length and contain only samples of the songs. I posted  this project with the desire to see people engaging in a musical journey by having to search out the songs in their entirety. I also had quite a few previous videos containing Classical music taken down under copyright laws. After looking up these laws I noticed that one may simply provide most of the song without the ending and be able to get away with it. So I hope you enjoy this work and then go out and either buy or download the original music that I have presented here.  Paintings are by Claude Monet.  Music to elevate the soul and exult the divine.These are foretastes of late France's exuberant Impressionist Composers such as Maurice Ravel, along with Erik Satie, followed by Camile Saint Saens, in close suit Gabriel Faure and no other but the painter of sound; Claude Debussy.  This presentation is graced by the French Impressionist Artist hallowed as Claude Monet, who painted using an array of rich colors during the same time that Mr. Debussy was bent over his mysterious piano.  here is the necessary composition guide: Musical pieces:   0:00 Clare de Lune (Claude Debussy) 1:50 Estampes Pago (Claude Debussy) 3:36 The Snow is Falling (Claude Debussy) 5:52 Preludes Voiles (Claude Debussy) 7:10 Estampes la Soriee (Claude Debussy) 9:00 Gymnopedie 1 - Lent et Douloureux (Erik Satie) 10:48 Gnossienne 1 - Alessio Nanni (Erik Satie) 12:34 Nocturne no. 1 (Erik Satie) 14:24 Ma Mere l'Oye Pavane Belle (Maurice Ravel) 16:13 Ma Mere l'Oye Apotheose (Maurice Ravel) 18:01 Une Barque sur l'Ocean (Maurice Ravel) 19:50 Piano Concerto No. 3 (Saint Saens) 21:39 The Bird House (Saint Saens) 22:47 The Swan (Saint Saens) 24:37 Apres un Reve (Gabriel Faure)",

All the older songs, including this, should now be more available. =)  -  'The Pit Song' is an original Portal song. A rough draft of this song was originally created 3 years ago for the Portal Youtube series 'The Underground'. It was a darker-themed Machinima and one of the episodes would feature 'The Pit'; where bots are tortured, destroyed, reappropriated, or just left to rot. All lovely fun for the whole family! I was to expand on it for a future episode. The series unfortunately went into indefinite hiatus, so the song was never finished...until now!  3 years later and I finally got around to remaking it using what I've learned over the years. A lot of you wanted this finished, including myself, so I hope you enjoy it! It was a lot of fun to make something darker and creepier. =D  This took about a month of dedicated work; which was initially slowed down a lot because I've had a lot of other large projects to work on these past few months. Got a lot more stuff coming in the coming weeks / months though. ;)  The old version (made 3 years ago): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6sLPedbpd2o  VFX Breakdowns: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWYCVbO8NLw  -----  My other Portal songs you may enjoy!

Official Store: http://po.st/sajiZS, iTunes: http://po.st/LZdZ8Q, GooglePlay: http://po.st/E1IeUV Have a go at performing Einaudi yourself at http://po.st/EinaudiNightExclusive  Groundbreaking composer and pianist Ludovico Einaudi – whose unique musical style is renowned around the world – returns with a new album ‘Elements’. Recorded at Einaudi’s Italian home, ‘Elements’ features 12 tracks, which interweave piano, strings, percussion, guitar and electronica and it is simultaneously exhilarating and transcendent. It is inspired by nature’s elements, mathematical and scientific elements, musical forms and works of art.  Says Einaudi: “I saw new frontiers – on the edge between what I knew and what I didn’t know – that I had long wanted to explore: creation myths, the periodic table, Euclid's geometry, Kandinsky’s writings, the matter of sound, and of colour, the stems of wild grass in a meadow, the shapes of the landscape. For months I wandered in a seemingly chaotic mix of images, thoughts and feelings. Then, gradually, everything came together in a dance, as if all the elements were parts of the same world, and myself within it.”     #LudovicoEinaudi #Elements #Vevo",

Infected Mushroom - Liquid Smoke 🕒 1:04:41  Severe Warning: A rare fungal ear infection originated in 1996 is about to re-infect on January 30  Since they first emerged with their phenomenal premiere album "" The Gathering"" , the trance duo "" Infected Mushroom""  changed the face of Psychedelic trance music forever.  Their new album, "" Return To The Sauce""  includes nine new tracks arising powerful scents of the past. Like mushrooms that have grown on their land, so noticeable is the feeling that the duo created the album within their most natural place. The album throws the listener far away to a musical experience in the style of the early years of the mushroom. Contaminated from beginning to end, the album glorifies the three-dimensional sound signature of the duo, along with multi-layered melodies and riding on an aggressive baseline galloping ahead with full power.  The result is a terrifying and unrestrained experience. As an infection, keeping its original shape yet still evolving and growing stronger, the album is well-imbedded inside its original roots, yet contains a clear and contemporary statement as well as a look far ahead into the future.

There is something about the passage of time, and the exploration of the past that is fascinating. To uncover relics forgotten, to awaken slumbering gods, or loot golden coins with stamps in undecipherable languages.

I'm finished making sense Done pleading ignorance That whole defense  Spinning infinity, boy The wheel is spinning me It's never-ending, never-ending Same old story  [Chorus (x2):] What if I say I'm not like the others? What if I say I'm not just another one of your plays? You're the pretender What if I say I will never surrender?  In time or so I'm told I'm just another soul for sale... oh, well The page is out of print We are not permanent We're temporary, temporary Same old story  [Chorus x2]  I'm the voice inside your head You refuse to hear I'm the face that you have to face Mirrored in your stare I'm what's left, I'm what's right I'm the enemy I'm the hand that will take you down Bring you to your knees  So who are you? Yeah, who are you? Yeah, who are you? Yeah, who are you?  Keep you in the dark You know they all pretend  [Chorus x2]  [x2] What if I say I'm not like the others? (Keep you in the dark) What if I say I'm not just another one of your plays? (You know they all... pretend) You're the pretender What if I say I will never surrender?  So who are you?

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=heHc41h47I8,Song,330,Pirates of the Caribbean (Froto Remix),"Although the first movie came out over 10 years ago and the last one in 2011, I decided to make a remix to this famous theme song from Disney's Pirates of the Caribbean and treat it with a big room sound.  I was originally inspired by the song Tsunami by DVBBS & Borgeous because it gave off a great naval vibe and I thought it would interesting to mash it up with the Pirate's theme.  However, after experimenting with a direct mash-up I found out that it actually didn't work so I decided instead to construct a remix from scratch.  Hence after working on this track throughout winter break, this remix was born! Elements include a naval battle vibe as well as  I also wanted to incorporating imagery of large boat party where perhaps the pirates are celebrating a recent victory.  The Jack Sparrow sample should also be instantly recognizable.  This remix includes mix in points both in the beginning and end so DJ's can easily incorporate this song into their set.  Dancers in the crowd should recognize that familiar pirate melody and get right into it.

Lunatic Soul is the solo project from Mariusz Duda , the creative force, lead singer and talented multi-instrumentalist behind Poland's Progressive Rock shooting stars Riverside.  "" Walking On A Flashlight Beam - the title indicates living in a world of imagination, in a place that's made up and unreal. You can have your head in the clouds, you can chase after rainbows so you can walk on a flashlight beam too. It's a story about choosing to be alone, inspired by the life of people who were completely alienated and withdrawn from social life, who shunned all interactions with the outside world. It's about people who, even on a bright and sunny day, have the curtains drawn and the blinds closed in their rooms. Such people are usually surrounded by books, films, games, figments of other people's imagination. I've written about solitude and living in a world of fiction before in Riverside's lyrics but now I've decided to write a whole album about it.""   ‘Walking On A Flashlight Beam’ is the fourth album from Lunatic Soul and follow up to  2011’s acclaimed ‘Impressions’ album and comprises of almost 64 minutes of brand new music. Commenting on his new opus  Duda says  “These are very dark and intense compositions but very melodious too. I think it’s one of the best things I’ve ever written, if not the best one”. The first single & video due to be taken from the new album will be for the track ‘Cold’. As with previous Lunatic Soul albums artwork was created by the renowned cover artist Travis Smith who has previous created covers for the likes of Opeth & Riverside.  ‘Walking On A Flashlight Beam’ is available as a 2 disc media book featuring a 25 minute bonus disc of interview footage entitled ‘In Between’, which plots the creative course Mariusz Dada takes between working in Riverside to his solo work in Lunatic Soul.

The world as you know it has fallen apart, it is but here in the afterlife you might find comfort, if you can find her, you have to. The city mourns with you as the fog rolls in over rusted docks. Shadows crawl across boarded up windows and dilapidated store fronts. Empty streets and frozen winds echo in the void and in your orphaned soul. You were loved once but now walk alone, drifting slowly with a heartache that shatters worlds.  Using synths, drones, live instruments and field recordings, the album takes us on a journey that's both dreamy and harrowing. Recommended for fans of emotional piano movements and the foggy atmospheres of Silent Hill.

I've teamed up with Joypad Records to officially license this track and ensure the original artist and myself are compensated! If you've tried throwing your money at the screen and it's not working, you can show your love and support to us as artists by picking up a copy from iTunes http://blake.so/vgo1, or from the new Loudr store http://blake.so/vgo1jp  An orchestration of 'Sweden' / Calm3 from the Minecraft soundtrack by C418. It was made a while back and I never posted it as I wasn't completely satisfied with how it came out. I was woken up and listening to it again this morning and it's growing on me so I figured I'd share. It's a really relaxing song - always makes me think of random Minecrafting I've gotten up to in the early hours. Take it as a mini-gift for 1.3's release today!

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GKA0SqOq3mU,Playlist,3522,Kayleth - Colossus (Full Album),"Kayleth - Colossus (Full Album) You would be forgiven if you assumed you were basking in the American sun, surrounded by desert in southern California or the swamps and bayous of Louisiana. The way the riffs barrel down from the skies and roll across the rugged landscape are all too similar to the giants roaming, or who have roamed, those lands. The way the songs radiate the lands all around, warming them up and giving birth to new life, and transforming even the most barren corners on the planet. Alas, this colossal power has its origins in the Italian sun; its rays heating up the lands of Verona have stirred the beast by the name of Kayleth from its slumber. The world is in need of healing in these dark times, and their sophomore effort is exactly how the cure should sound: warm, vibrant, and almighty! Enter the Colossus…  Released way back in the gloomy beginnings of 2018 on Argonauta Records, Colossus came out of nowhere demanding an audience, igniting the ashen hearth ablaze with the promise of a brighter tomorrow, and leading a procession of gallant followers – fed by good vibes and magmatic furore – into the cold of night. With the immediacy of a starting pistol, Kayleth’s follow-up to the splendour that is Space Muffin fills the listener with a warmth so intoxicating it is almost impossible to abscond from; their souls glowing with the rich hues emanating from the album’s lush tones. Forging the rhythms synonymous with ‘90s grunge with the bold fuzz and heaviness mastered by legendary acts such as Kyuss and Monster Magnet – like some lovechild between Pearl Jam and Sigirya – it’s difficult to realise this is only Kayleth’s second album in their thirteen year existence; their ability to craft such sunkissed tunes ought to be known throughout the stoner rock community, more so as summer is just around the corner, for these twelve songs are crying out to bask in the scorching glory of our celestial neighbor.  What sets Kayleth apart from their contemporaries is exactly this, as few bands deliver such warmth with their level of consistency, especially with Enrico Gastaldo’s pipes soaring above Massimo Dalla Valles’ eruptive riffs and Alessandro Zanetti’s smouldering bass rumbles; interwoven into these grooves are the pulsating synths masterfully projected by Michele Montanari’s psyche. Colossus is song after song of this: from the glistening space rock of ‘Ignorant Song’ and the introspective meditations of ‘The Spectator’ and ‘Pitchy Mantra’ to the frenetic Clutch-like ‘So Distant’ and the crushing doom of the sci-fi-laden ‘Mankind’s Glory’ – no doubt the highlight on an album full of instant classics – there is no end to the positive and uplifting energy this band seamlessly manifests. Just like some beastly juggernaut, this is energy which continuously builds across the entire runtime right until its hallucinogenic end, culminating in almost an hour of pure feel-good music.  And feel-good it most certainly is: it is difficult not to smile whilst basking in the glow of Colossus’ life-affirming presence. A beacon in the darkness when times are tough, it is fuelled by the intense Verona sun and fused into its beating heart with all the good vibes one would expect from any well-revered stoner rock outfit and deserves just as much attention and success as better-known albums.  The time has come for Kayleth to shake off their underdog status and claim their rightful place as one of stoner rocks greatest discoveries.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ozN068aZg4,Song,218,"Air Traffic - "" No More Running Away"" ","http://www.air-traffic.co.uk http://www.myspace.com/airtraffic  Following the release of their acclaimed debut album 'Fractured Life' on July 2nd, Air Traffic will go back on the road for another bout of touring this autumn, to support the release of next single 'No More Running Away' on 24th September.  Cited by many critics as an album highlight, 'No More Running Away' is centred around its heaven-bound anthemic chant earthed throughout by tribal drums,  and is, a fine -- if not the finest -- example of the more intelligent, complex side to the songwriting and musicianship on the album.",

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dM6lFQysxtg,Song,270,The Light - The Album Leaf,"This is a video for the lovely and reflective instrumental piece, The Light, by The Album Leaf. This is my second Album Leaf video, after my previous one, for their song, Window. Like with my last video, you'll notice I picked a theme to go with the title of the song, which is quite obvious. :) Also, just to add, lately this theme has been resonating with my own life. I have been challenged to think differently, having my eyes opened to possibilities, and to hope, that I had not really entertained much before... deep matters about how I view God, my faith, my life, and everything... It's been a lonely struggle at times, and I won't say that it's all clear, and I still have questions and fears and doubts, as I always do, but I believe I'm being moved in the right direction, and it's like the light is gradually coming on in the darkness, showing the way out... hard to describe really... and I'm not even totally sure yet. Only time will tell. But I think all of us can relate to the desire to find light in this often dark world that we live in, light and love to lead us through and out of the dark and scary places we can find ourselves in... often I've seen myself as a boy stuck in a dark room, and I need someone to open the locked door, let the light stream in, and carry me out into freedom ... may we all find our way through the dark, and into the light...",

She’s a party girl and she’s had a lot She tried to quit yeah but she just can’t stop She goes to 11 Send her to heaven  She went fast and she went slow And she’s breaking my knees Waves would crash in her undertow She’s got eyes she couldn’t see it though Molly won’t you come back But she’s all gone  Send her to heaven Could you send her to heaven? She’s a piece of string and she’s tied in knots She tried to quit, but she just can’t stop She goes to 11 Send her to heaven  See the way she hides behind All the little white lies That she tells you When she bites her pillow She let’s go, just so slow  Sent her to heaven You sent her to heaven now Flying high as a kite Was she high enough She said it was good But it must have been rough She goes to 11 Sent her to heaven  She said she was going with her best friend Kevin (Sent her to heaven) She was last seen in the parking lot of a 7-11 (Sent her to heaven) Send her to heaven  Official Site: http://www.allamericanrejects.com/ Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/AllAmericanRejects/ Twitter: https://www.twitter.com/TheRejects/ Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/TheRejects/  #theallamericanrejects #sendhertoheaven #epitaph",

Reinforcing their chemistry as a duo, the ’Saudade EP’ is a showcase of hard-hitting synths and deft percussive builds.  Opening track ’Saudade’ is characteristically dark and progressive, favouring staccato synths on a driving bassline. Hard and fast, second cut ‘What U Need’ provides an intense contemporary take on the classic vocal-led anthem, whilst closing track ‘Castellar’ is the lightest on the release, combining detuned toplines and stuttered mallets suited to sunlit dancefloors.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5P-VKUTp6qE,Song,373,Battles - Fort Greene Park (Official Video),"Directed by Colin Read, Battles’ ‘Fort Greene Park’ video is a love letter to New York City, bringing together a small army of skaters, cyclists, joggers, scooterists, rollerbladers, and veritably every other method of self-transport into an extended crew of DIY transportation-enthusiasts.  ‘Fort Greene Park’ features on Battles’ new album ‘Juice B Crypts’, available now on WARP → https://battles.ffm.to/juicebcrypts.oyd  “A lot of things going on here for me. My daughter called her little brother Juice B Crypts when he was born. I didn’t know what that meant. But here the opening shot is of him climbing the Prison Ships Martyr Monument in Fort Greene Park, which is an actual crypt, and near to where I lived for 13 years. The place played a central role in my life for a long time. On another level, one of the guys from the building where I live rides an E-Unicycle around my neighborhood and was the original kernel of an idea for this video. So he and his friends are the e-unicyclists. My daughter and her kindergarten friends are the kids on the scooters. Other friends of ours are some of the skaters. And Colin elevated the concept of the video extending it into a broader story about the evolution of human transport which is a contentious issue these days in our city of New York. But in the end, it just a love letter to the place we live. New York City.” – Ian (Battles)  Can you guess all of the modes of transport used in the video?

Their sound is pure soulful jazz with scratches aplenty and the result is like a weird trawl through a dusty basement full of the best records you have never heard of, whilst a voice you cant quite pin down sings hooks you cant forget.

On your back with your racks as the stacks as your load In the back and the racks and the stacks of your load In the back with your racks and you're un-stacking your load  This is not the sound of a new man or crispy realization It's the sound of the unlocking and the lift away Your love will be Safe with me",

A brief description of the video from Brett himself:  "" It is our routines and our comforts that allow us to ignore social issues.  For some of us, it is our privilege to be ignorant.  This video tells the story of social issues challenging our privileges and entering our routines making them impossible to ignore.  Social injustice cannot be ignored when you are forced to deal with them.  That is the idea behind this video.  What would happen if you were forced to deal with something that you may think has nothing to do with you?  If suddenly the world's problems came into your own home?  You would have to realize that you are connected to everything and everyone one earth.""

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wC16FJTI6XM,Song,688,burial - kindred,"Off the three, "" Kindred""  (12-minute symphony No. 1) will be the most recognizable to Burial die-hards, featuring that same clanking metal-on-metal garage skip-and-swing. But this time something just feels heavier, harder, more devastating. Burial's been credited since the beginning as a prophet tying together UK genres old and new, but there's never been a better argument than "" Kindred"" , which hints at the agility of jungle with the lead-footed heft of dubstep as seen through elliptical garage beats. They tumble and timestretch like vintage Metalheadz underneath smouldering Reese basslines, and the vocals lack Burial's usual phrases, instead choking out syllables smothered by the aural ash and soot that seems to soak the recording in a humongous, unearthly rumbling. As a whole "" Kindred""  sounds bigger than anything he's done before, an infinitely detailed behemoth that lumbers and shakes the ground beneath it with every little stroke of movement.  cut from the article of, http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16292-kindred/  https://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=100003504560916 https://www.facebook.com/pages/MusicIsMySavior/328225397227553",

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XYGOLzMgI88,Song,245,"Cherry Ghost - "" People Help The People"" ","http://www.cherryghost.co.uk  Following on from his debut release 'Mathematics', Cherry Ghost is back with a new single 'People Help The People'.  After the gentle bittersweet melancholia of his debut single 'Mathematics', Cherry Ghost shows a more passionate side with his single, 'People Help The People' on Heavenly Recordings.  Theme-wise it's firmly rooted in trademark Cherry Ghost territory -- a lament by the perennial outsider looking for a home. With it's anthemic chorus, soaring strings and piano and Aldred's rough-diamond vocals 'People Help The People' is a lyrically sophisticated song that combines poetry and rousing melody to create music with both drama and darkness. It also cements Cherry Ghost's knack of creating songs based on personal stories that have universal appeal.", 
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXi6hg90LUU,Song,207,"Cherry Ghost - "" 4am"" ","http://www.cherryghost.co.uk http://www.myspace.com/cherryghostband  '4 AM' is the third single from Cherry Ghost, already recognised as one of most exciting new bands of the year.  Their first album Thirst For Romance debuted in the Top 10 and received outstanding plaudits across the board. After a series of sell-out gigs around the UK and festival appearances at Glastonbury and Latitude among others, the band continue to find new fans with their unique blend of electrified poetic storytelling. Cherry Ghost are that rare thing -- a commercially successful group who have got there on their own terms and by doing what they do best -- which is quietly but persistently creating atmospheric, intelligent music that's not afraid to be bold. With a repertoire of songs that go way beyond catchy melodies and rousing choruses, Cherry Ghost manage to create a musical world of their own that's as strong and as all-encompassing as a fictional voice.",

And if we're good we'll lay to rest, Anywhere we want to go.  In your house I long to be; Room by room patiently, I'll wait for you there like a stone. I'll wait for you there alone.  And on my deathbed I will pray to the gods and the angels, Like a pagan to anyone who will take me to heaven; To a place I recall, I was there so long ago. The sky was bruised, the wine was bled, and there you led me on.  #Audioslave #LikeAStone #Vevo",

It says, that white people invented it, in order to humble population groups of black skin colour with this word.  The lyrics say: Goddamn my man you see I can't understand Why you wanna say Nigger to your brother man Talk about black pride then you call yourself a Nigger Don't bring yourself down cos it just don't figure Take a look at yourself and your history You don't look like a goddamn Nigger to me It's a negative word and the white man made it Gave you a name to dominate and trade it Making blood money of this very own race man And all of this because the colour of your face man  In German: Verdammt, verstehst du das? Ich kann es nicht verstehen: Warum nennst du deinen Bruder Nigger? Du redest vom Stolz der Schwarzen und nennst dich selbst einen Nigger, Mach dich nicht so runter, das ist doch sinnlos. Sieh dich selbst und deine Geschichte an: Für mich siehst du nicht wie ein gottverdammter Nigger aus. Es ist ein negatives Wort, und der Weiße hat es erfunden, Er gab dir einen Namen, dich zu dominieren und zu verkaufen, Und machte mit seiner eigenen Rasse blutiges Geld Und all das nur wegen der Farbe deines Gesichts",

Can you hear me, Major Tom? Can you hear me, Major Tom? Can you....  Here am I floating round my tin can Far above the Moon Planet Earth is blue And there's nothing I can do.",

They are mainly known for their high-charting singles "" Blue (Da Ba Dee)""  and "" Move Your Body"" , and their 1999 studio album Europop. Their following two albums, Contact! (2001) and 2003 self-titled album, did not have significant international success, but charted in Italy.  "" Blue (Da Ba Dee)""  is a song by Italian music group Eiffel 65. It was first released in October 1998 in Italy and became internationally successful the following year. It is the lead single of their debut album Europop. The song is the group's most popular single, reaching number one in many countries such as Ireland, the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, France, Sweden, Switzerland, New Zealand, Finland, Norway, Australia, Germany and Hungary, as well as reaching number six on the Billboard Hot 100 in the United States. In the United Kingdom, the song originally entered the top 40 purely on import sales; it was only the third single to do this. The song also received a Grammy Award nomination for Best Dance Recording at the 2001 Grammy Awards, 2 years after it was released.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3XJRk8Cyag,Song,272,Eiffel 65 - Move Your Body,"Eiffel 65 is a three man (Gianfranco Randone, Maurizio Lobina, and Gabriele Ponte) Italian eurodance group. Best know for their international hit "" Blue (Da Ba Dee)""  Eiffel 65's debut album "" Europop""  sold over two million units in the US, making them the best selling Italian eurodance group ever in the United States. The origin of the group's name is an interesting sequence of chance. The name "" Eiffel""  was chosen randomly by a computer program and the "" 65""  was scribbled onto their name on a demo by mistake; it was actually part of a phone number. The group Eiffel 65 is also known for their many remixes of songs from other artists, with over thirty of them to their name. In 2005 Gabriele Ponte left the group to focus on his solo career and in 2006 the reminding members left the Bliss Corporation to form their own duo called Bloom 06. The Bliss Corporation, who owns the name Eiffel 65, had announced a new line up for the group would be debuting in the summer of 2007 however the debut was postponed until further notice.",

I can't sleep, something's all over me Greasy, insomnia please release me And let me dream about making mad love to my girl on the heath Tearing off tights with my teeth But there's no relief I'm wide awake in my kitchen It's black and I'm lonely Oh, if I could only get some sleep Creeky noises make my skin creep I need to get some sleep I can't get no sleep",

It instantly became a regular to end the bands live sets, but has been occasionally rested from this position for a cover of "" Breed""  by Nirvana, while so far has never been used as one of the "" Feeder covers""  at Renegades gigs. "" Just a Day""  has sold over 100,000 downloads and physical copies.", 
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COy_JKXtzvE,Song,196,Feeder - 'Buck Rogers' - Official Music Video - HD,"Buck Rogers""  is a song performed by the British rock band Feeder. It was written by frontman and lead guitarist Grant Nicholas for the band's breakthrough album Echo Park. The song was originally written by Grant for an American band called 'Radio Star', but the band's label and producer Gil Norton liked the song and convinced the band that it could be a hit for them. It later became a cult classic and massive success despite leaving the top 40 only after 4 weeks and entering the UK charts at #5, meaning that the single exceeded expectations set out by the record label and the media. It is seen by many fans of British rock music as an iconic rock song of 2001 and a festival anthem, as a result it is still played on UK radio today. It was also performed by the band at the Live 8 concert in Edinburgh",

No wonder man Now our whole damn city's torn asunder man Under water but we still don't understand We see hurricane spills overrun the land Through gaps you couldn't fill with a hundred tons of sand No we still don't understand We've seen planes in the windows of buildings crumbled-in We've seen flames send the chills through London And we've sent planes to kill them and some of them were children But still we crumble-in the building Underfunded but we still don't understand Under god but we kill like the son of Sam But if you feel like I feel like about the son of man We will overcome  So stand up We shall not be moved Except by a child with no socks and shoes If you've got more to give then you've got to prove Put your hands up and I'll copy you Stand up We shall not be moved Except by a woman dying from a loss of food If you've got more to give then you've got to prove Put your hands up and I'll copy you  I said put your hands up and I'll copy you Put your hands up and I'll copy you If you've got more to give then you've got to prove Put your hands up and I'll copy you  We shall not be moved Except by a child with no socks and shoes Except by a woman dying from a loss of food Except by a freedom fighter bleeding on a cross for you We shall not be moved Except by a system that's rotten through Neglecting the victims and ordering the cops to shoot High treason now we need to prosecute  So stand up We shall not be moved And we wont fight a war for fossil fuel It's times like this if want to plot a coup Put your hands up and I'll copy you Stand up We shall not be moved Unless we're taking a route we have not pursued So if you've got a dream and a lot to do Put your hands up and I'll copy you  I said put your hands up and I'll copy you Put your hands up and I'll copy you If you've got a dream and a lot to do Put your hands up  Now shake, shake A polaroid dream Nightmare negatives develop on the screen We sit back and wait for the government team Criticize they but who the fuck are we The people want peace but the leaders want war Our neighbors don't speak, peek through the front door House representatives preach "" stay the course""  Time for a leap of faith Once more  Put your hands up high if you haven't imagined Hope that the pen strokes stronger than the cannon Balls to the wall, nose to the grindstone My interrogation techniques leave your mind blown So place your bets let's speak to the enemy Don't let 'em pretend that we seek blood And who's we anyways Kemo Sabe? Mighty warlord wanna-be street thug A threat for a threat leaves the whole world terrified Blow for blow never settles the score Word for word it's time we clarify We the people did not want war  So stand up We shall not be moved Except by a child with no socks and shoes If you've got more to give then you've got to prove Put your hands up and I'll copy you Stand up We shall not be moved Unless we're taking a route we have not pursued So if you've got a dream and a lot to do Put your hands up and I'll copy you  I said put your hands up and I'll copy you Put your hands up and I'll copy you If you've got a dream and a lot to do Put your hands up",

Following up his UK number one hit as Tubeway Army (Are 'Friends' Electric?), Cars launched Gary Numan's solo career with another UK number one. Built around analogue synthesisers with no guitar, this was the purest form of Gary's 'Machine Music' and the track has subsequently been sampled on numerous occasions. Promotional videos were also a rarity at the time and this one created the defining image of Gary Numan.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0WNbm1jz6A,Song,325,Tubeway Army / Gary Numan -  Are 'Friends' Electric? 1979,"For those that still can't get their heads around the fact - I created this little video in 2001. The idea was simply to showcase this amazing track. In the original description, I made it clear that it was my first attempt using windows movie maker as I had just purchased my first computer,  and I made no secret of the fact. Whether your comments are positive or negative, it doesn't matter....just listen to the song! It doesn't matter whether some console game bought you here either...just listen to the song! I said I'd take it down after 1,000,000 views as that was my aim, but it's now gone way past that and that's a good thing....isn't it? For the last time though...Don't waste your time trolling, life is too short. If what you class as 'enjoyment' is trolling, and hiding behind a keyboard....well, what a sad little world you must live in. One final thing - The Sugababes were'nt even born when this was originally released in 1979! There was never an official video for this classic song so that's why I mucked about with some images. Maybe one day I may get round to doing a proper one?",

But you didn't have to cut me off Make out like it never happened And that we were nothing And I don't even need your love But you treat me like a stranger And that feels so rough You didn't have to stoop so low Have your friends collect your records And then change your number I guess that I don't need that though Now you're just somebody that I used to know  I used to know That I used to know  Somebody... *************",

LYRICS Just waking up in the morning And to be well, Quite honest with ya, I ain't really sleep well Ya ever feel like your train of thought's been derailed? That's when you press on - Lee nails Half the population's just waitin to see me fail Yeah right, you're better off trying to freeze hell Some of us do it for the females And others do it for the retail  But I do it for the kids, life threw the towel in on Everytime you fall it's only making your chin strong And I'll be in your corner like mick, baby, til the end Or when you hear a song from that big lady  Until the referee rings the bell Until both your eyes start to swell Until the crowd goes home What we gonna do ya'll?  Give em hell, turn their heads Gonna live life til we're dead. Give me scars, give me pain Then they'll say of me, say of me, say of me There goes the fighter, there goes the fighter Here comes the fighter That's what they'll say of me, say of me, say of me, This one's a fighter  And if I can last thirty rounds There's no reason you should ever have your head down Six foot five, two hundred and twenty pounds Hailing from rock bottom, loserville, nothing town  Text book version of a kid going nowhere fast And now I'm yelling "" kiss my ass""  It's gonna take a couple right hooks, a few left jabs For you to recognize you really ain't got it bad  Until the referee rings the bell Until both your eyes start to swell Until the crowd goes home What we gonna do ya'll?  Give em hell, turn their heads Gonna live life til we're dead. Give me scars, give me pain Then they'll say of me, say of me, say of me There goes the fighter, there goes the fighter Here comes the fighter That's what they'll say of me, say of me, say of me, This one's a fighter  Everybody put yo hands up What we gonna do ya'll?  If you fall pick yourself up off the floor (get up) And when your bones can't take no more (c'mon) Just remember what you're here for Cuz I know Imma damn sure  Give em hell, turn their heads Gonna live life til we're dead. Give me scars, give me pain Then they'll say of me, say of me, say of me There goes the fighter, there goes the fighter Here comes the fighter That's what they'll say of me, say of me, say of me, This one's a fighter  'Til the referee rings the bell 'Til both ya eyes start to swell 'Til the crowd goes home, What we gonna do kid?",

Set in a desolate, post-apocalyptic landscape, the video features performances from contemporary ballet dancer and choreographer Josh Johnson. Hercules & Love Affair’s Andy Butler drafted in renowned fashion designer Bernhard Willhelm, who has previously worked together with Bjork, to give the video its distinctive fluorescent tribal look. Directed by AlexandLianne, the video was shot with infra-red cameras, giving this party at the end of the world a strange but vibrant hue.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P-aRAhigP1I,Song,250,The Hold Steady - You Did Good Kid,"You Did Good Kid""  is the third track on the upcoming album Thrashing Thru The Passion out on Frenchkiss Records, 8/16/19.  Preorder the record here: https://orcd.co/thrashingthruthepassion  Constructive Summer 2019 shows: https://theholdsteady.net/  https://www.theholdsteady.net/ https://www.facebook.com/TheHoldSteady/ https://twitter.com/theholdsteady https://www.instagram.com/theholdsteady  You did good kid. You did good kid.  When your low serotonin's got you brittle and glitchy And your friend from the null set isn't calling you back yet And your opening bombs and you're a few beats up ahead of the laugh track.  How you gonna talk about who's toxic or not? You gonna pick thru the pills? You gonna call in the cops? The comedian claimed that he forgot all his props. And the jokes don't really work well without them.  We were sleeping on the shuttle on the way to the club. And the holy perception and  the most precious blood It flooded the ruts and it soaked the upholstery. The driver made us walk the remainder.  She came around the corner with a diplomat's shake. And some kind of crystal container. Yeah, mutually assured destruction is oftentimes a no brainer.  The drifters in the kitchen Were thrashing thru the passion. Boys, let's try to keep it on the carpet. You wouldn't be so impressed with the sunrise If it wasn't for the darkness.  You did good kid. You did good kid.  But you settled for the first girl that said you were sweet. You bought a little house up on Sycamore Street. You hung around the money until they cut you a piece. You did good kid. You did good kid.  But the things they didn't tell you when you went off to work. How does it feel? Where does it hurt? You can't see the wires when they're under his shirt. But they're taking down every single detail.  He came into the club with  the commemorative plates. A depiction of The Slaughter at Shiloh. The light in his eyes was diminished But they announced his arrival.  Once the assistant hitched us into the harness The wolves all started acting kinda sheepish. Woke up in a bed with a spray painted mattress Dripping wet with the emotional weakness.  And every single moment gets abandoned and emptied. Every single speaker gets blown. And now you wanna go home.  Oh dude. They made a movie starring you. Oh man. This wasn't what you planned.  You fold your hands and you laugh at the jokes. You did good kid. You did good kid. Oaks and acorns. Acorns and oaks. You did good kid. You did good kid. Searching out another mouth in the smoke. You did good kid. You did good kid.  You did good kid",

It's not always easy and sometimes life can be deceiving I'll tell you one thing, it's always better when we're together  Mmmm, It's always better when we're together Yeah we'll look at the stars and we're together Well, it's always better when we're together Yeah it's always better when we're together  And all of these moments just might find their way into my dreams tonight, But I know that theyll be gone when the morning light sings and brings new things for tomorrow night you see that theyll be gone too, too many things I have to do But if all of these dreams might find their way into my day to day scene I'd be under the impression i was somewhere in between With only two, Just me and you, Not so many things we got to do or places we got to be We'll sit beneath the mango tree, now,  Yeah It's always better when we're together Mmmm, we're somewhere in between together Well, it's always better when we're together Yeah, it's always better when we're together  mmmmmmm  I believe in memories they look so, so pretty when I sleep Hey now, and when I wake up, you look so pretty sleeping next to me But there is not enough time, There is no, no song I could sing and there is no combination of words I could say but I will still tell you one thing We're Better together",

"" THE COLOR OF POMEGRANATES (1969) Sergei Paradjanov's baroque masterpiece was banned in the Soviet Union for its religious sentiment and nonconformity to "" Socialist realism"" ; its director, a tirelessly outspoken campaigner for human rights, was convicted on a number of trumped-up charges and sentenced to five years of hard labor in the gulag. A wave of protest from the international film community led to his release in 1978. Aesthetically the most extreme film ever made in the U.S.S.R., Pomegranates, his hallucinatory epic account of the life of the 18th Century Armenian national poet, Sayat Nova, conveys the glory of what a cinema of high art can be like.""

Central to the project is Ben Watkins, who has been collaborating with changing ensemble of musicians from across the world. The project currently consists of Ben Watkins and Mike Macguire. At one time or another, Juno Reactor also included Johann Bley, stephen holweck and Jens Waldenback. Juno reactor is probably one of the most famous electronic music bands in the world, composing music to The Matrix films and for several computer games. Transmissions is the 1993 debut album by the multi-genre band, released in 1993 by NovaMute Records. Transmissions was one of the first successful (Goa) trance albums ever. The first track on the album is Juno Reactor's biggest club hit, "" High Energy Protons,""  a curious track that translates three-chord heavy metal through some 303 acid with a few suitably trippy vocals. The trippy feeling given by this track continues throughout the entire album, making it the psychedelic, alternately spacy journey it is.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ebnJOnKlLCQ,Song,273,King Creosote - Nothing Compares To You,"The cover of Sinead O’Connor ‘Nothing Compares To You’ seemed to sum up the essence of the whole night. The original version of this song is a dramatic ballad about yearning for lost love but King Creosote’s stripped-down reimagining of the song could only bring a smile to one’s face.  Scottish singer/songwriter Kenny Anderson is King Creosote, who has also been a part-time member of Magnetophone and U.N.P.O.C., and has performed with Adem. He had previously been the vocalist for Skuobhie Dubh Orchestra and Khartoum Heroes. Anderson has prolifically released over two dozen CD-Rs on his own label, Fence, a collective assembled along with brothers Een (aka Pip Dylan) and Gordon (aka Lone Pigeon). In 2003 Domino pressed the first proper album Kenny and Beth's Musakal Boatrides, followed in 2005 by Rocket D.I.Y. Released in 2006, KC Rules OK included liner notes from famed Scottish crime writer Ian Rankin, and garnered both regional and international acclaim. Bombshell arrived in 2007, followed by Flick the Vs in 2009. The compilation Thrawn -- representing Anderson’s first official stateside release -- was issued in 2011, and Diamond Mine, a collaboration with British ambient artist Jon Hopkins, also arrived that year. Diamond Mine proved to be a major critical success in the U.K. landing on various year end lists and earning Anderson and Hopkins a Mercury Prize nomination. Signing to Domino Records, Anderson re-recorded his 2010 D.IY. album That Might Be It, Darling for his new label, retitling it That Might Well Be It, Darling in 2013. The following year, he provided the soundtrack to a documentary about his home country called From Scotland with Love, which was released to coincide with the 2014 Commonwealth Games held in Glasgow. After a handful of new D.I.Y. releases on Fence, Anderson returned with his Domino follow-up, Astronaut Meets Appleman, in 2016",

Something lost and never seen. Everytime I start to believe, Something's raped and taken from me... from me. Life's got to always be messing with me. (You wanna see the light) Can't they chill and let me be free? (So do I) Can't I take away all this pain. (You wanna see the light) I try to every night, all in vain... in vain. Sometimes I cannot take this place. Sometimes it's my life I can't taste. Sometimes I cannot feel my face. You'll never see me fall from grace Something takes a part of me. You and I were meant to be. A cheap fuck for me to lay Something takes a part of me. Feeling like a freak on a leash. (You wanna see the light) Feeling like I have no release. (So do I) How many times have I felt diseased? (You wanna see the light) Nothing in my life is free... is free  #Korn #FreakOnALeash #Vevo #Rock #OfficialMusicVideo",

It is their first album without long-time guitarist Brian "" Head""  Welch and the last album with original drummer David Silveria.  "" It's funky, it's heavy, it's dark, and sometimes, industrial-tinged. Working with so many different people and everything, it's made it out to be a really well-rounded album of a lot of different things. It's definitely Korn, it's definitely groove-oriented. But it's our most experimental album to date.""  ~ Jonathan Davis  Album CREDITS  Jonathan Davis -- Vocals, Bagpipes James "" Munky""  Shaffer -- Guitars Reginald "" Fieldy""  Arvizu -- Bass David Silveria -- Drums  Atticus Ross -- Production, Songwriting, Keyboards, Strings The Matrix -- Production, Songwriting Terry Date -- Mixing  Twsited Transistor LYRICS  Hey you, hey you, Devil's little sister. Listening to your, Twisted transistor. Hold it between your legs, Turn it up, turn it up. The wind is coming through, Can't get enough.  A lonely life, Where no one understands you. But don't give up, Because the music do...  Music do! x6  Because the music do, And then it's reaching, inside you, Forever preaching. "" Fuck you too!""  Your scream's a whisper. Hang on you, Twisted transistor.  Hey you, hey you, Finally you get it. The world ain't fair, Eat you if you let it. And as your tears fall on, Your breasts, your dress. Vibrations coming through, You're in a mess.  A lonely life, Where no one understands you. But don't give up, Because the music do...  Music do! x6  Because the music do, And then it's reaching, inside you, Forever preaching. "" Fuck you too!""  Your scream's a whisper. Hang on you, Twisted transistor.  Music do! x8  Hey you, hey you, This won't hurt a bit. This won't hurt a bit, This won't hurt... Says who, says who. Anesthetize this bitch. Anesthetize this bitch, anesthetize! Just let me be, Between you and me, Don't fit...  Don't fit!  Music do, And then it's reaching, Inside you, forever preaching. "" Fuck you too!""  Your scream's a whisper.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P2K7D-uMH2g,Song,359,Ludovico Einaudi - I Giorni,"I giorni""  di Ludovico Einaudi.  Why a hippo? This is the question.  Official answer: "" The inspiration for Ludovico Einaudi's I Giorni was a 12th-century folk song from Mali about a hippopotamus who was cherished by the residents of a nearby village but killed by a hunter. 'The song,' writes Einaudi in his succinct liner note, 'is sung as a lament for the death of a king or a great person or for the loss of a loved one.' The result is a tender and introspective set of 14 piano pieces. This work was written after Einaudi heard the kora playing of Toumani Diabate whilst travelling in Mali.""   Unofficial answer: "" Hippo was a cryptic message, for a person but I did not think that all these people would have seen this video, I didn't think that all these people (in the world!) knew Ludovico Einaudi :D""  ... sorry for my English",

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4NDqFvUsDhI,Song,216,The Miserable Rich - On A Certain Night,"iTunes - http://bit.ly/missitunes Amazon - http://amzn.to/missamazon  On A Certain Night is the first single from The Miserable Rich's forthcoming album Miss You in the Days.  Taking as its themes ghost stories, sex and death, the album was recorded in February this year, in some of the most haunted houses in Britain -- including the Jacobean palace Blickling Hall, the birthplace of Ann Boleyn. According to local legend her headless ghost returns there each year on the anniversary of her execution.  Lyrically, On A Certain Night is a tale of possession -- both sexual and supernatural. Lead singer James de Malplaquet's first love told him how she was possessed by a spirit in the form of a light that would appear in her room, enter her body and tell her what to do...  Some years later while writing the album, de Malplaquet was struck by the sexual nature of possession, and how someone hearing moaning at night might come to very different conclusions about what they were hearing - if they were in a haunted house, as opposed a hotel room, for example.  He was also struck by the power and dominance of a spirit that cannot be kept in bounds by physical restraints. As James says "" the problem with ghosts is you can't just lock them out"" .  On A Certain Night reflects the more dynamic, edgier sound of the new album, bursting with hooks and bags of energy, with the band's trademark plaintive violin, cello and double bass joined by guitars, charango and drums.

Would you live each moment like your last? Leave old pictures in the past Donate every dime you have? If today was your last day  Against the grain should be a way of life What's worth the prize is always worth the fight Every second counts 'cause there's no second try So live like you'll never live it twice Don't take the free ride in your own life  If today was your last day And tomorrow was too late Could you say goodbye to yesterday? Would you live each moment like your last? Leave old pictures in the past Donate every dime you have? Would you call old friends you never see? Reminisce old memories Would you forgive your enemies? Would you find that one you're dreamin' of? Swear up and down to God above That you finally fall in love If today was your last day  If today was your last day Would you make your mark by mending a broken heart? You know it's never too late to shoot for the stars Regardless of who you are So do whatever it takes 'Cause you can't rewind a moment in this life Let nothin' stand in your way Cause the hands of time are never on your side  If today was your last day And tomorrow was too late Could you say goodbye to yesterday?  Would you live each moment like your last? Leave old pictures in the past Donate every dime you have? Would you call old friends you never see? Reminisce old memories Would you forgive your enemies?

Nights out in babylon, yeah, nights out in babylon. But maybe all you need is someone to trust, maybe all you need is someone. And I won’t let you down, no I won’t let you down. I won’t let you down, my love. I won’t let you down.  Now Emily’s got no tricks to try, but she don’t seem that much to mind, no she don’t seem to mind that much to me. And you’ve got what the whole world wants, so strap that armor tighter on, double on down like it’s gonna make you free. But maybe all you need is someone to trust, maybe all you need is someone. And I won’t let you down, no I won’t let you down. I won’t let you down, my love. I won’t let you down.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EnqkthF1dsY,Playlist,3000,PENGUIN CAFE (The Imperfect Sea),"Penguin Cafe is a band originally conceived by Arthur Jeffes, son of Simon Jeffes and Emily Young, as a continuation of his father's project, the Penguin Cafe Orchestra. Penguin Cafe's current ten-person line-up was originally brought together in 2009, featuring a group of musicians ranging from "" luminaries from The Royal College of Music to members of bands such as Suede and Gorillaz"" . The group produced their first album, A Matter of Life... in 2010, which was released on their own Penguin Cafe label. Despite the similarities in genre and name, the group is distinct from the original Penguin Cafe Orchestra.  The album title ( The Imperfect Sea) refers to a saying by his father that “we wade in a sea of imperfections…”, reflecting upon the idea that beauty can be found amongst the chaos. “If there is a narrative to the album it’s coming to the acceptance of the imperfections in all aspects of life; moreover, the recognition that these imperfections and tiny randomnesses are in fact what make up the best parts”, Arthur explains. “For this album I wanted to effect a departure from where we’d been up to now. The idea was to create a musical world that would feel familiar to an audience more used to dance records but stay true to our own values. So we replaced electronic layers with real instruments: pads with real string sections, synths with heavily-effected pianos, and atmospheric analogue drones with real feedback loops ringing through a stone and a piano soundboard”  Track Listing:  01 Ricercar 04:34 02 Cantorum 07:23 03 Control 1 (Interlude) 06:57 04 Franz Schubert 05:46 05 Half Certainty 02:31 06 Protection 05:22 07 Rescue 06:29 08 Now Nothing (Rock Music) 04:38 09 Wheels Within Wheels 06:20  Personnel  Arthur Jeffes: piano (1,2,3,6,7,8,9), percussion (1,6,9), electric bass guitar (7), dulcitone (4,5,9), tape block (5), Fender Rhodes (5,6), violin (3), celeste (4,9), rock (3,8), melodica (5), Khono acoustic guitar (6), harmonium (3,4,7); Andy Waterworth: double bass (1,2,4,6), electric bass guitar (4,7); Neil Codling: Khono acoustic guitar (6), ukelele (6,9), kalimba (4); Des Murphy: ukelele (1,4,9), celeste (2,7), tape block (5); Tom Chichester Clark: cuatro (1,6,7,9); Peter Radcliffe: percussion (1,2,6,9), shruti (3); Cass Browne: percussion (1,2,7,9); Oli Langford: violin (1,2,6,7), viola (7); Rebecca Waterworth: cello (2,3,4,7), salt bowl percussion (4); Vincent Greene: viola (1,2,4,6,7,9); Darren Berry: violin (2,7), percussion (7,9); City of Prague Philharmonic: additional string recordings (7,9)  Composed by Arthur Jeffes (7, 9) and Oli Langford (7); Guy Protheroe: arranger, musical director and conductor.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YR5ApYxkU-U,Song,360,Pink Floyd - Another Brick In The Wall (HQ),"HIT SUBSCRIBE FOR MORE CLASSIC VIDEOS  Pink Floyd - Another Brick In The Wall  Lifted from "" Pink Floyd The Wall""  film, this video is actually comprised of two songs: "" The Happiest Days Of Our Lives""  and "" Another Brick In The Wall Pt. 2""  This video became the official video of "" Another Brick In The Wall Pt. 2""  after the release of the film in 1982.  This single is by far Pink Floyd's greatest ever mainstream success, instantly attaining classic status, and is perhaps their most famous piece of work.  ABINTW Pt. 2 even became the protest song of a group of South African students during the apartheid regime, the song was subsequently banned in South Africa.  The song itself is a protest against the rigidity of British schools, and in particular, the boarding school system Waters would have been part of as a young boy.  The poem read out by the schoolteacher is a direct reference to "" Money""   The schoolteacher in this video was portrayed by the late, great, Scottish actor Alex McAvoy who passed away in June 2005.  If you haven't seen "" The Wall""  I would Highly recommend you to do so.", 
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWGE9Gi0bB0,Song,802,Pink Floyd - Shine On You Crazy Diamond [ Official Music Video ],"Shine On You Crazy Diamond""  is a nine-part Pink Floyd composition written by Roger Waters, Richard Wright and David Gilmour. It is a tribute to former band member Syd Barrett. The song was first performed on their 1974 French tour, and recorded for their 1975 concept album Wish You Were Here. The song was intended to be a side-long composition (like "" Atom Heart Mother""  and "" Echoes"" ), but was ultimately split into two parts and used to bookend the album, with new material composed that was more relevant to this song, and to the situation in which the band found themselves.  | http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shine_On_You_Crazy_Diamond  Lyrics:  Remember when you were young, you shone like the sun. Shine on you crazy diamond. Now there's a look in your eyes, like black holes in the sky. Shine on you crazy diamond. You were caught in the cross fire of childhood and stardom. Blown on the steel breeze. Come on you target for faraway laughter. Come on you stranger, you legend, you martyr, and shine!  You reached for the secret too soon, you cried for the moon. Shine on you crazy diamond. Threatened by shadows at night, and exposed in the light. Shine on you crazy diamond. Well you wore out your welcome with random precision. Rode on the steel breeze. Come on you raver, you seer of visions. Come on you painter, you piper, you prisoner, and shine", 
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IXdNnw99-Ic,Song,293,Pink Floyd - Wish You Were Here,"Pink Floyd, Wish You Were Here (1975)  So, so you think you can tell Heaven from Hell, Blue skys from pain. Can you tell a green field From a cold steel rail? A smile from a veil? Do you think you can tell?  And did they get you to trade Your heros for ghosts? Hot ashes for trees? Hot air for a cool breeze? Cold comfort for change? And did you exchange A walk on part in the war For a lead role in a cage?  How I wish, how I wish you were here. We're just two lost souls Swimming in a fish bowl, Year after year, Running over the same old ground. What have we found? The same old fears. Wish you were here.",

Order the 25th anniversary album:  http://found.ee/REM-automatic25-r  R.E.M. is excited to announce the reissue of their landmark album Automatic For The People to commemorate the record's 25th Anniversary. Due November 10 via Craft Recordings, the remastered album will be available in a variety of formats, the most extensive of which is the Deluxe Anniversary Edition, which will feature the album in its entirety mixed in Dolby Atmos.  The album (plus bonus track “Photograph,” featuring Natalie Merchant) was remixed in Dolby Atmos by Automatic’s original producer, Scott Litt, and engineer, Clif Norrell. This technology delivers a leap forward from surround sound with expansive, flowing audio that immerses the listener far beyond what stereo can offer. It transports the listener inside the recording studio with multi-dimensional audio – evoking a time when listening to music was an active, transformative experience, and reigniting the emotion you felt when you first heard the album in 1992.  R.E.M.’s Automatic For The People is the first album to be commercially released in this expressive, breathtaking format.  In addition, the 4-disc Deluxe Edition will offer a wealth of previously unreleased material. The band selected 20 never-before-heard demos from the LP’s sessions, including the fully-realized, unreleased track “Mike’s Pop Song” and the oft-mused about song, “Devil Rides Backwards.”  Stream or download “Mike’s Pop Song”: http://found.ee/REM-MikesPopSong-r Preorder the album:  http://found.ee/REM-automatic25-r  Learn more about #AUTOMATIC25 at REMHQ: http://found.ee/REMHQ-r  ——————— Subscribe for more R.E.M.: http://bit.ly/subscribe-to-remhq  Follow On: YouTube: http://found.ee/REM-youtube-r Facebook: http://found.ee/REM-Facebook-r Twitter: http://found.ee/REM-twitter-r Instagram: http://found.ee/REM-instagram-r Spotify: http://found.ee/REM-spotify-r-1 Apple Music: http://found.ee/REM-apple-r REMHQ: http://found.ee/REMHQ-r</a",

We're the renegades of funk (funk!)  We're the renegades of funk (funk!) We're the renegades of funk (funk!)  From a different solar system many many galaxies away We are the force of another creation A new musical revelation And we're on this musical mission to help the others listen And groove from land to land singin' electronic chants like Zulu nation Revelations Destroy all nations(x2)   Now renegades are the people with their own philosophies They change the course of history Everyday people like you and me We're the renegades, we're the people With our own philosophies We change the course of history Everyday people like you and me C'mon!   We're the renegades of funk (funk!) We're the renegades of funk (funk!)  We're the renegades of funk (funk!) We're the renegades of funk (funk!)   We're poppin', shockin', rockin', put a side of hip-hop Because where we're goin' there ain't no stop Poppin', shockin', rockin', put' a side of hip-hop Because where we're goin' there ain't no stop We Poppin',and shockin',and rockin', and put a side of hip-hop! 'Cause we're poppin', shockin', rockin' put a side of hip-hop Poppin', shockin', rockin', put a side of hip-hop!   We're the renegades of funk (funk!) We're the renegades of funk (funk!)  We're the renegades of funk (funk!) We're the renegades of funk (funk!)   We're teachers of the funk And not of empty popping We're blessed with the force and the sight of electronics With the bass, and the treble the horns and our vocals 'Cause everytime I pop into the beat we get fresh!  There was a time when our music Was something called a Big Street beat People would gather from all around To get down to the big sound You had to be a renegade in those days To take a man to the dance floor  Say jam sucka!(JAM SUCKA) Say jam sucka!(JAM SUCKA) Say groove sucka (GROOVE SUCKA) Now groove sucka (GROOVE SUCKA) Say dance sucka (DANCE SUCKA) Say dance sucka (DANCE SUCKA) Say move sucka (MOVE SUCKA) Now move sucka (MOVE SUCKA) (x2)   We're the renegades of funk (funk) We're the renegades of funk (funk)  We're the renegades of funk (funk) We're the renegades of funk (funk)  We're the renegades of funk (funk) We're the renegades of funk (funk)  We're the renegades of funk (funk) We're the renegades of funk (funk)",

Some try to hand me money, they don't understand I'm not broke â?? I'm just a broken-hearted man I know it makes no sense but what else can I do? How can I move on when I'm still in love with you?  [Chorus:] 'Cause if one day you wake up and find that you're missing me And your heart starts to wonder where on this earth I could be Thinking maybe you'll come back here to the place that we'd meet And you'll see me waiting for you on the corner of the street  So I'm not moving, I'm not moving  Policeman says, Son, you can't stay here. I said, There's someone I'm waiting for if it's a day, a month, a year. Gotta stand my ground even if it rains or snows. If she changes her mind this is the first place she will go.

Barbarisms by Barbaras With pointed heels. Victorious, victories kneel. For brand new spankin' deals. Marching forward hypocritic And hypnotic computers.

Dancing in the desert blowing up the sunshine.  Kneeling roses disappearing, Into Moses' dry mouth, Breaking into Fort Knox, Stealing our intentions, Hangars sitting dripped in oil, Crying FREEDOM!

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3FsrPEUt2Dg,Song,338,U2: Where The Streets Have No Name,"Where the Streets Have No Name (The Joshua Tree, 1987)  Where the Streets Have No Name is a song by U2, from their 1987 album, The Joshua Tree. It peaked at #14 in Canada, #10 in The Netherlands and #4 in the United Kingdom. The song became a staple of live shows, being played 645 times at 642 shows since its inaugural performance 2 April 1987 in Tempe, Arizona. Its critical reception was mostly warm, praised by music critics such as Rolling Stone magazine. In Rolling Stone issue 1054, the song was ranked 28th in the issues list of the 100 Greatest Guitar Songs of All Time. This song is played during the home introduction of the Baltimore Ravens of the NFL and the Vancouver Canucks of the NHL. It was the theme song for ESPNs coverage of the 2006 World Cup.  Lyrics  I want to run I want to hide I want to tear down the walls That hold me inside I want to reach out And touch the flame Where the streets have no name  I want to feel, sunlight on my face See that dust cloud disappear without a trace I want to take shelter from the poison rain Where the streets have no name  Where the streets have no name Where the streets have no name Were still building Then burning down love, burning down love And when I go there I go there with you... (Its all I can do)  The cities a flood And our love turns to rust Were beaten and blown by the wind Trampled into dust Ill show you a place High on the desert plain Where the streets have no name  Where the streets have no name Where the streets have no name Still building Then burning down love Burning down love And when I go there I go there with you (Its all I can do)  The Joshua Tree is the fifth studio album by U2, released in 1987. The album features the bands exploration of roots rock, with their music exhibiting influences from bluesrock, folk rock, country music, and gospel music. Lyrically, The Joshua Tree depicts the bands fascination with America, but also its discontent with the foreign policy of the United States. The album increased the bands stature from heroes to superstars, according to Rolling Stone magazine. The album produced several hit singles, including Where the Streets Have No Name, With or Without You, and I Still Havent Found What Im Looking For, all of which remain radio staples. The Joshua Tree won Grammy Awards for Best Rock performance by a Duo or group with Vocal and Album of the Year in Grammy Awards of 1988. In 2003, the album was ranked number 26 on Rolling Stone magazines list of The 500 Greatest Albums of All Time. The album is one of the worlds bestselling albums of alltime, having sold over 25 million copies.  Note: This is a fan made video clip for entertainment purposes only.

Down in the hollow Playing a new game, Laughing and a-running, hey, hey, Skipping and a-jumping In the misty morning fog with Our, our hearts a-thumping And you, my brown-eyed girl, You, my brown-eyed girl.  Whatever happened To Tuesday and so slow Going down to the old mine with a Transistor radio. Standing in the sunlight laughing Hide behind a rainbow's wall, Slipping and a-sliding All along the waterfall With you, my brown-eyed girl, You, my brown-eyed girl.  #VanMorrison #BrownEyedGirl #Vevo #Rock #VevoOfficial",

To touch something real, Will help your wounds heal, Like the sun on your face, The dreams of starry nights.

(Please click on 'CC' button or activate 'Interactive Transcript' function)  :: iTunes DL : https://itunes.apple.com/us/album/blockbuster/id571165868  They are finally back. During their gap, they thought deeply about the new album as a result they came up with the new album "" BLOCKBUSTER"" . Showcase will start October17th with online publishing and they will start from there.  There first regular album title "" NILLILI MAMBO""  has the concept of pirates. On the grand and fancy orchestra music there is hip-hop beat added to create the song 'NILLILI MAMO'. This song is selected since it can make people dance to it.  They only debuted about two years ago, but through their first album "" BLOCKBUSTER""  we hope that they can come back and reach the top this time.  ▶ LOENMUSIC FB : http://www.facebook.com/LOENMUSIC.official ▶ LOENMUSIC TW : https://twitter.com/LOEN_MUSIC  Block B(ブロック・ビー) _ NILLILI MAMBO(ニリリマンボ) MV 長い空白の時間を経て久しぶりに彼らが帰ってきた。 その間ブロック・ビーのメンバーたちが真剣に悩んで努力した結果の産物である彼らの１stフルアルバム[BLOCKBUSTER]がいよいよ姿を現す。 10月17日オンライン音源リリースを皮切りに、待ってくれたファンたちへの恩返しとしてショーケースを行って、本格的な活動を始める予定だ。  ブロック・ビーの１stフルアルバムのタイトル曲「ニリリマンボ」は、'海賊'というコンセプトで作った曲だ。勇壮で華麗なオーケストラ編曲にヒップホップのビートをのせて誕生した「ニリリマンボ」は、興じて踊れる感じを盛り込もうとつけたタイトルだ。  デビューしてまだ2年もたたない彼らだが、１stフルアルバム[BLOCKBUSTER]で歌謡界でもう一度頂点に達することができるか彼らの歩みが注目される。  긴 공백을 깨고 그들이 돌아왔다. 공백 기간 동안 블락비 멤버들이 진지하게 고민하고 노력해온 결과의 산물로 그들의 첫 정규 앨범 "" BLOCKBUSTER"" 가 드디어 모습을 드러낸다. 10월 17일 온라인 음원 발매를 시작으로 기다려준 팬들에 대한 보답으로 쇼케이스를 진행하고, 본격적인 활동을 시작할 예정이다.  블락비 정규 1집 앨범 타이틀 곡인 "" 닐리리맘보"" 는 "" 해적"" 이라는 컨셉을 가지고 만든 곡이다. 웅장하고 화려한 오케스트라 편곡에 힙합 비트를 얹어 탄생한 "" 닐리리맘보"" 는 흥에 겨워 춤출 수 있는 느낌을 담아내고자 제목이 최종적으로 선정되었다.  아직 데뷔한 지 갓 2년도 안된 그들이지만 첫 정규 앨범 "" BLOCKBUSTER"" 를 통해 가요계에서 다시 한 번 일어나 정점을 찍을 수 있을지 그들의 행보가 주목된다.",

This time it's an older piece brough up to date. This was composed for the Multivaders album for a sudden unveiling of a traitor amongst the 'good guys' - I used crazy violins and strings to try and make it dramatic sounding. This version has been remastered and extended from the album release. It has boosted strings, new melodies, a choir and more percussion. If you're interested in the full soundtrack, it's still up on iTunes/Amazon/etc (just search for Multivaders).

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FveFmShXoRE,Song,321,(Breaking Bad) Walt & Jesse || TIME,"*1080p for Best Quality*  MAJOR SPOILERS INCLUDED FOR THE ENTIRE SERIES OF BREAKING BAD  https://twitter.com/aaronpaul_8/status/664863594794901508  This is my entry for contest I've been involved with for a while. My group's April category was focused on enemy/rivaly relationships, so I chose one of my favorite dynamics in all of television.... Walt & Jesse. It's amazing how this video is 5 1/2 minutes long but I still feel like I barely scratched the surface of these two characters.  I ended up focusing the video mostly from Jesse's point of view, so it might also serve as a bit of a Jesse character study if you'd like to view it that way.  Hope you guys enjoy!

My name’s ‘Blurryface’ and I care what you think  Wish we could turn back time, to the good ol’ days, When our momma sang us to sleep but now we’re stressed out.  Sometimes a certain smell will take me back to when I was young, How come I’m never able to identify where it’s coming from, I’d make a candle out of it if I ever found it, Try to sell it, never sell out of it, I’d probably only sell one,  It’d be to my brother, ‘cause we have the same nose, Same clothes homegrown a stone’s throw from a creek we used to roam, But it would remind us of when nothing really mattered, Out of student loans and treehouse homes we all would take the latter.  My name’s ‘Blurryface’ and I care what you think  Wish we could turn back time, to the good ol’ days, When our momma sang us to sleep but now we’re stressed out.  We used to play pretend, give each other different names, We would build a rocket ship and then we’d fly it far away, Used to dream of outer space but now they’re laughing at our face, Saying, “wake up, you need to make money.""   Wish we could turn back time, to the good ol’ days, When our momma sang us to sleep but now we’re stressed out.  #twentyonepilots #StressedOut #Blurryface",

In their own special way. All that you rely on And all that you can fake Will leave you in the morning But find you in the day  Oh you're in my veins And I cannot get you out Oh you're all I taste At night inside of my mouth Oh you run away Cause I am not what you found Oh you're in my veins And I cannot get you out.  Everything will change. Nothin stays the same. And nobody here's perfect. Oh but everyones to blame All that you rely on And all that you can save Will leave you in the morning And find you in the day  Oh you're in my veins And I cannot get you out Oh you're all I taste At night inside of my mouth Oh you run away Cause I am not what you found Oh you're in my veins And I cannot get you out.  No I cannot get you out. No I cannot get you.  Everything is dark. It's more than you can take. But you catch a glimpse of sun light. Shinin, down on your face.  Oh you're in my veins And I cannot get you out Oh you're all I taste At night inside of my mouth Oh you run away Cause I am not what you found Oh you're in my veins And I cannot get you out.",

You just don't know it yet but you love me and I love you the same One day we'll have a pretty wedding and I'll be your everything We'll be together, yes forever, we will never ever part Oh you don't know it yet but baby I've already got your heart  Some call it stalking, I say walking just extremely close behind I'm sure if I sat down and asked you, well you really wouldn't mind.. You've got those eyes that drive me crazy, and I've got eyes to watch you sleep I brought a pack lunch and some coffee for my stakeout in your tree... outside your house.. Gotta be as quiet as a mouse, or else you'll call the police And I'll get done for somethin' stupid like disturbance of the peace and piece by piece I am collecting all the things you leave behind and when you don't I rummage through your bins to see what I can find...  You just don't know it yet but you love me and I love you the same One day we'll have a pretty wedding and I'll be your everything We'll be together, yes forever, we will never ever part Oh you don't know it yet but baby I've already got your heart  Used: FL Studio 10, Kontakt 5, FM8, Spitfire Albion & Harpsichord, Orange Tree Samples Core Bass Pear & Pineapple Ukelele",

The Vowels, Pt 2","I'm not a ladies man, I'm a land mine Filming my own fake death Under an '88 Cavalier I go But-but-but-but nothing but the rear bumper's blown But I's born for this flight United 955 on the fifth of July Back to SFO I-I join the dark side In a thin disguise On consumer grade video at night  Faking suicide for applause In the food courts of malls And cursing racing horses on church steps Playing the wall at singles bingo All-time gringo Did anyone hear me cry there? Through a toilet stall divider I swear I care, raw  Am I an example of a calculated birth? To a star chart for clowns, I'm not Under robin eggs in a nest, you hit a manila envelope With one last little robin's egg in it A hollow bullet yet spent Subject to dismissal I wish all my pitfalls Could be caught by this call  Cheeri-a, cheeri-e, cheeri-i, cheeri-o, cheeri-u",

I searched up high... I searched down low... But... no matter where I look no friends began to show and so I made a list of killers, and wrote them all letters asking lots of friendly questions... with all the best intent they told me  Don't ask your questions to the wall They keep their secrets locked inside If blood and bones are what you want I suggest that you look behind you  I keep each letter in a box under my bed It really rocks 'cos when I'm sad I just read all of them again I sent them drawings done in crayon, and plans for domination even cute little collages of their exploits from the papers. And when they get out, we will be friends Bestest buddies un-til the end We'll go on picnics, with long pork sammies But I keep thinking 'bout...

And just as El Gitano, this release features very differential remixes for house music lovers of all kinds: The two label managers Greg Silver and Chico Chiquita added a rougher electro-driven remix, typical for their pumping house sound as DJs. The second remix comes from the young but extremely gifted Kevin Over from Germanys Ruhr-Area. Kevin adds some deeper, but very funky grooves to Café Prague and will gain the friendship of many tech-house and Mannheim-House lovers...",

All nine parts of Shine On You Crazy Diamond, which is one of the greatest pieces of music made. This composition was a tribute to former band member, Syd Barrett. Written and performed by Roger Waters, David Gilmour and Richard Wright. From the album "" Wish You Were Here"" .  Lyrics: (Parts I-V) Remember when you were young, you shone like the sun. Shine on you crazy diamond. Now there's a look in your eyes, like black holes in the sky. Shine on you crazy diamond. You were caught on the crossfire of childhood and stardom, blown on the steel breeze. Come on you target for faraway laughter, come on you stranger, you legend, you martyr, and shine! You reached for the secret too soon, you cried for the moon. Shine on you crazy diamond. Threatened by shadows at night, and exposed in the light. Shine on you crazy diamond. Well you wore out your welcome with random precision, rode on the steel breeze. Come on you raver, you seer of visions, come on you painter, you piper, you prisoner, and shine! (Parts VI-IX) Nobody knows where you are, how near or how far. Shine on you crazy diamond. Pile on many more layers and I'll be joining you there. Shine on you crazy diamond. And we'll bask in the shadow of yesterday's triumph, sail on the steel breeze. Come on you boy child, you winner and loser, come on you miner for truth and delusion, and shine.",

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmWNGCmOhu4,Song,255,No Man's Sky -  Trailer Orchestra (65daysofstatic Debutante Orchestra),"Here's an orchestration of a song used in the trailer of the game I'm probably most excited for - Hello Games' No Man's Sky. The track is from a recent album by 65daysofstatic (who are also working on the game's soundtrack).  Does it really count as a video-game orchestration? Probably not, but thanks to the first trailer, it's the tune most people associate with No Man's Sky at the moment. It proved a bit difficult to translate from the style of the original, so I tried to focus on the building melody throughout the piece while playing with rhythms and patterns.  If you don't know what No Man's Sky is, be sure to check out http://www.no-mans-sky.com/about/ for [limited] details. Want to hear more awesomeness from 65daysofstatic?

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ly060HzsBXs,Song,268,Googolplex - Blind (2012),"Googolplex - Behind The Eye (2012)  Glo-Fi Dream Pop Band 'Googolplex' Released Debut Album 'Behind The Eyes' In a local scene heavily dominated by guitar-driven indie rock acts, Seoul-based Googolplex shine through as harbingers of a new generation of electronic bedroom artists in East Asia. Their recently released album Behind the Eyes sports nine tracks filled with simple, blissful synthesizers and minimal beats that introduce the listener to a spectrum of imagery-inducing sounds that range from a sunny beer with friends on the beach to a lonely stroll through the city on a dark, foggy night. Some of the darker tracks kindly provide melodic guitars and distant, drowned out vocals that help guide the listener through the misty, nostalgic compositions. While Googolplex share common ground with some of their glo-fi forbearers, they clearly discern themselves through their own unique ensibilities. Well-placed samples and melodies shyly reveal an eclectic variety of influences ranging from Soul and R&B to dream pop and shoegaze. Having shared the stage in their native Korea with acts including Toro y Moi and Max Tundra, they are no strangers to their more acclaimed counterparts; and with the release of Behind the Eyes, Googolplex may be soon joining their ranks. Have a listen to Behind the Eyes at their Bandcamp: http://bandgoogolplex.bandcamp.com/  And if it's to your liking, feel more than free to share their music!  http://www.fndt.co.kr http://www.facebook.com/bandgoogolplex http://soundcloud.com/googolplex-2  Download Link http://itunes.apple.com/us/album/behind-the-eyes/id496803148?uo=4",

Listen here: http://smarturl.it/SleepingO_All ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- The official music video for "" Beggar in the Morning""  by The Barr Brothers, from the album The Barr Brothers (2011, Secret City Records). Directed by Sebastian Lange. Puppets by Stephan Bircher ( http://www.stephanbircher.com/). Produced by Opak Media.  "" The idea for the Beggar in the Morning video came after I met the artist Stephan Bircher in British Columbia. A friend of mine was sharing an art opening with him. The next day I went out to his studio and was introduced to this wonderful dark and playful world of his imagination -- objects from the natural world - bones, shells, skulls - reused and redefined with rusty old machine parts. With the flick of a switch, it all comes to life. I always thought that a video would be the best way for people to see his work, since its very involved and expensive for him to dismantle his figurines and set them up somewhere else. Ideally, this video is beneficial for both The Barr Brothers and Stephan, as I hope more people will be introduced to this very unique and imaginative artist. The director, Sebastien Lange had to travel to British Columbia to film the figurines as they cannot be transported...""  - Brad  Official site: http://www.thebarrbrothers.com On Facebook: http://www.facebook.com/thebarrbrothers On Twitter: http://www.twitter.com/thebarrbrothers On iTunes: http://itunes.apple.com/us/album/the-...

Enjoy the video, and check out the lyrics below.  This video was recorded using Fraps, and run with Project 64. The Great Mighty Poo song and Conker's Bad Fur Day are trademarks of Rareware, and blahblahblah...  Lyrics -  Great Mighty Poo: Ahem-hem. Mi mi mi mi miiiii ... I am the Great Mighty Poo and I'm going to throw my shit at you. A huge supply of tish comes from my chocolate starfish. How about some scat, you little twat?  Great Mighty Poo: Do you really think you'll survive in here? You don't seem to know which creek you're in. Sweet corn is the only thing that makes it through my rear. How d'you think I keep this lovely grin? (Have some more caviar!)  Great Mighty Poo: Now I'm really getting rather mad. You're like a niggly tiggly shitty little tag-nut. When I knock you out with all my bab, I'm going to take your head and ram it up my butt! Conker: Your butt? Great Mighty Poo: My butt! Conker: Your butt?! Great Mighty Poo: That's right, my butt! Conker: Err ...! Great Mighty Poo: My butt! Conker: Agh! Great Mighty Poo: My Buuuuuuuuutt!  Great Mighty Poo: Ah! You cursed squirrel! Look what you've done! I'm flushing! I'm flushing! Oh, what a world, what a world! Who'd have thought a good little squirrel like you could destroy my beautiful clagginess! Ah! I'm going! Oh! Ahh! No! Aaaaaaah! Conker: Huh huh!

Sometimes when you're scared to take a look At the corner of the room You've sensed that something's watching you  Have you ever been alone at night Thought you heard footsteps behind And turned around and no-one's there? And as you quicken up your pace You find it hard to look again Because you're sure there's someone there  Watching horror films the night before Debating witches and folklore The unknown troubles on your mind Maybe your mind is playing tricks You sense, and suddenly eyes fix on dancing shadows from behind  Fear of the dark, fear of the dark I have constant fear that something's always near Fear of the dark, fear of the dark I have a phobia that someone's always there  When I'm walking a dark road I am a man who walks alone...",

This song itself is a musical sequel to 'Adventures in your Sleep' from my first originals album.

Which one do you prefer - the version on the first album or this new one? Answers in the comments!  Thanks to everyone who picked up a copy of the original album, as well as my other music.

There was also the problem of, "" How do I turn a 15 second theme into a 4 minute remix,""  but here it is.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Csj2K-jD25Y,Song,961,Majora's Mask Epic Orchestral Medley,"Download high quality version here: https://rebeccatripp.bandcamp.com/track/Majoras-Mask-Epic-Orchestral-Medley  This is my Majora's Mask Epic Orchestral Medley.  I've had this planned for quite some time now!  Mostly, I've been working on long Final Fantasy medleys, but I felt it was time to deviate from my usual routine and create a Legend of Zelda one.  How do you like it?  I put every single ounce of love, care, attention and passion into this one.  (I even worked on it on my birthday!) In a way, this medley tells a story.  It starts out with the intro music, where Link is traveling in the forest, just before he meets Skullkid.  It then transitions into the song of Healing, representing his journey to get his humanity back and his first steps into Termina.  Following this, it deals with the lore, strife, mystery and danger all over the land, right up until the final moments before the moon falls, during which, the song becomes very somber indeed.  As I composed that part (Final Hour) I thought to myself "" Everyone dies- even I am going to die!""  as chilling waves of existential dread washed over me.  After this, I transitioned the arrangement into the Astral Observatory melody (which I hope will be comforting), thinking to myself "" Human lives are not eternal, but there is a vast universe out there- something much bigger and, perhaps, transcendental and even meaningful to contemplate.""   I followed this with the reunion music, thinking to myself that, maybe, there can only really be one eternal thing- something which transcends both time and space.  "" Perhaps this thing is love?""  I thought to myself as I slaved away at the computer.  The Clock Tower theme followed this, closing the loop the Song of Healing began, now wizened and ethereal, utilizing choral singing, Tibetan chants and chimes: a fitting theme for the Happy Mask Man, in my opinion.  Perhaps he is immortal in some way.  Perhaps he knows everything we (and Link + the residents of Termina) can't know.  After this, the song of time, the Sun's Song and Termina Field represent rebirth; they also represent the presence of Link, whose Triforce of Courage allows the player to defeat their greatest enemies, conquer their fears and revisit the past.  🍨 Buy me an ice cream: https://ko-fi.com/rebeccaetripp  Here is a list of all of the tracks included in this medley:  Opening Scene Song of Healing Elegy of Emptiness Oath to Order Deku Palace Stone Tower Temple Kamaro's Dance (with elements of Majora's Theme) Woodfall Swamp Clock Town (Day 2 with elements of Day 3) Final Hour/Last End Astral Observatory Tatl and Tael Reunited Clock Tower Song of Time Sun's Song Termina Field  Note: I do not own any of the images I used in this video!

I'm gonna keep it frozen here forever, There's no regretting anymore. It's worth the wait, even so far away. I'm making the night mine until the day I die No lights to brake when you're hanging by fate You know what it feels like when you're dancing blind All alone, just the beat inside my soul Take me home, where my dreams are made of gold In the zone where the beat is un-controlled. I know what it feels like Come on make me feel alive Feel alive, feel alive Feel alive, feel alive Feel alive, feel alive alive alive alive Alive!  Meet me under shining lights, I've been waiting right here all my life Feelings you can't deny that you're living, open up your eyes And I just wanna sink into your crazy laughter Come on make me feel until the pain don't matter Every second here makes my heart beat faster Finally think I found what I'm chasing after. All alone, just the beat inside my soul Take me home, where my dreams are made of gold In the zone where the beat is un-controlled. I know what it feels like Come on make me feel alive Feel alive, feelalive Feel alive, feel alive Feel alive, feel alive alive alive alive Alive!  All alone, just the beat inside my soul Take me home, where my dreams are made of gold In the zone where the beat is un-controlled. I know what it feels like Come on make me feel alive Feel alive, feel alive Feel alive, feel alive Feel alive, feel alive alive alive alive Alive! I know what it feels like Come on make me feel alive Feel alive, feel alive Feel alive, feel alive Feel alive, feel alive alive alive alive Alive!

For the life of me, I can't find it anywhere, on the OST, or anywhere else. If anyone does know, please let me know. A lot of people are wondering the same, so I thought I'd just make my own version of it.  A few people have wondered how I did this, I completely re-created the music from the ground up in Logic Pro X by re-orchestrating the strings, and playing my own piano. This isn't taken from the original in any way or form :)  Hope you guys like it!

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmMxZmerOFg,Song,504,The Middle East - Deep Water,"Lyrics: Green-eyed looker, it always pains me to see Hollowed out picture of skin and bone The strangest stranger that I ever did meet Oh and I guess I ain't that old  She came on strong with her own confidence Made you sweat in your cotton, though it'll breathe The cruelest behaviour ain't born or mined Feel her shell should just go and down the wine  It's deep water, driving rain And all I can remember is a cold Another burned out lover who was begging to leave She said "" why wouldn't you tie your soul to me?""   Took all I had in my waiting cell And a little of what I just don't know But I got my thinking up to where I fell And I let the memories of my lovers die  It's a bitter taste and a, a blinding light Time fade burns, most would know Took the hand of the, the woman I love Now I am sure I'm gonna make her my own  It's the deep water, the driving rain I'm making a shelter of my own When Jesus comes he's gonna eat with me And he's gonna find our children old  Got a road all laid out and trenched And mined enough for a walking pace It seems so different from where I've come Oh Lord I'd love to see that, that place again  With its deep water, mountain range Full of those hard living kind Petrol stations and a copper mine The kind of place I think I could die  Music: http://themiddleeastmusic.com/",

Von niemand Geringerem ist die Rede, als Robin Schulz. Der zum internationalen Star-DJ avancierte Osnabrücker bricht einen Rekord nach dem anderen. So enterte er als erster deutscher Künstler Platz 1 der weltweiten Shazam-Charts, wurde alleine in den vergangenen 18 Monaten mit 10 goldenen und sage und schreibe 30 Platin-Schallplatten ausgezeichnet und bringt mit seinen Eigenproduktionen wie „Sun Goes Down (feat. Jasmine Thompson)“ und auch Remixen für Größen wie David Guetta, Coldplay, Lykke Li und viele mehr die Tanzflächen rund um den Globus zum Kochen. Mit dem Track „Headlights“ veröffentlicht der 27-jährige Shootingstar nun am 03.04. den nächsten Megahit aus seinem reichhaltigen Fundus.  Mittlerweile zählt der Osnabrücker satte 17 Nr. 1-Platzierungen, konnte weit über 40 iTunes-Top-Positionen mit „Prayer in C“ weltweit einsacken, veröffentlichte mit „Prayer“ ein Top 10 Debütalbum und erreichte als bisher einziger deutscher Act mehr als 200 Millionen Views auf YouTube. Mit „Headlights“ unterstreicht Robin Schulz erneut seinen Status als einer der brillantesten und visionärsten Köpfe der elektronischen Clubmusik. Auf seiner brandneuen Single mixt Robin Schulz wie kein anderer warme, akustische Gitarrenklänge mit einer entspannt nach vorne gehenden Bassline, dramatischen Streichern und den markanten Vocals der kalifornischen Singer/ Songwriterin Ilsey. „Headlights“ lebt vom Kontrast aus fließenden House-Sounds und der mal verführerisch sanften, im nächsten Moment leidenschaftlich rauen Stimme Ilsey.  Premiert wurde der „Headlights“ erstmals bei der ECHO Verleihung 2015. Für den begehrten Preis ging Robin Schulz mit gleich drei Nominierungen in den Kategorien „Dance national“, „Newcomer national“ und „Hit des Jahres“ ins Rennen und performte einen Medley-Auftritt der Extraklasse. Neben tosendem Applaus für seine Performance räumte Robin Schulz so ganz nebenbei auch noch den Preis in der Kategorie „Dance National“ ab. Robin Schulz ist eben nicht nur ein Star seines Genres, sondern ein waschechter Pop-Star, der weiß was es heißt, die Massen zu bewegen.",

The song ranked No. 342 on the Rolling Stone list of "" The 500 Greatest Songs of All Time"" .[2] It was written by Dion with Ernie Maresca, and tells the story of a disloyal lover.  The lyrics are sung from the point of view of a man whose former girlfriend, named Sue, was extremely unfaithful. He warns all potential lovers to avoid her at all costs, as Sue "" runs around""  with every guy she meets and never settles down with any man in particular. He advises "" Now people let me put you wise, Sue goes out with other guys""  and suggests that potential suitors should 'keep away from Runaround Sue'.

No silly trinkets, silver, bronze, or gold. So Im told, so Im told.  He made a most delicious pumpkin pie, Which he presented to the passersby. Before the sun set hed be all but dry. Folks would buy the whole supply.     He lived alone, (He lived alone.)     And every night he sat upon a throne of pumpkin pie.     I do not know his name. (Hed never say his name.)     He never wanted all the fame that came with pumpkin pie.  Before you knew it he was in full swing. His pumpkin pies became the next big thing. Soon he was called upon to feed the king. And theyd sing, feed the king.  The pie of pumpkin filled the King with glee. He offered a castle for the recipe, but The merchant wouldnt even give it up for three. No not he, no not he.     He lived alone, (He lived alone.)     And every night he sat upon a throne of pumpkin pie.     I do not know his name. (Hed never say his name.)     He never wanted all the fame that came with pumpkin pie.  The king was angry and he came unwound. He called his men and soon the merchant found Himself in a torture chamber underground. Tied and bound, he sighed and frowned.  And so they tortured him for night and day. They made him scream so much his hair turned gray, but As for the recipe, he would not say. They could not flay his pride away.     He lived alone, (He lived alone.)     And every night he sat upon a throne of pumpkin pie.     I do not know his name. (Hed never say his name.)     He never wanted all the pain that came with pumpkin pie.",

And of them, a massive title song to represent the album! "" The Gloomy Song""   Making you laugh just with the introduction, their first full-length album is finally being released.  Having taken a year for preparation, the album "" Gangster Rap Volume 1"" , in which Chung Hyungdon produced and wrote the lyrics for the entire tracks, is deeply embedded with the heartfelt efforts of the members for the songs as they aimed to make each of them title songs. "" The Gloomy Song"" , the main title song for the album, is a gangster rap interpretation containing the humorous sensations of Hyungdon and Daejun about a broken-up couple. The music video -- in which the beautiful comedian "" Kim Hee-Won""  was threatened to star in -- released at the same time as the album, is already gathering much attention. It is a music video full of laughter you should not miss out on if you need a good laugh.
