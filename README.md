Younify
===========

This is a tool currently being developed to integrate youtube and spotify. If your work blocks spotify but allows youtube, or you have disparate libaries of 'bookmarks', you want those songs in spotify? 

This tool aims to fix that, with the eventual end being a simple button that can integrate in a browser of your choice, that when clicked will go grab the youtube tab you're on from spotify if it exists, and if it doesn't, it'll grab the file, download, convert, and put it in your local files for you.

This is currently pre-alpha, and will be difficult to use without some significant environment modifications, and understanding of how this terrible code is organised.

It might be worth adding the <path>/Younify directory to the PYTHONPATH user variable at this point in development for this to work properly.


A Section
=========

Lists look like this:

* First

* Second. Can be multiple lines
  but must be indented properly.

A Sub-Section
-------------

Numbered lists look like you'd expect:

1. hi there

2. must be going

Urls are http://like.this and links can be
written `like this <http://www.example.com/foo/bar>`_.
