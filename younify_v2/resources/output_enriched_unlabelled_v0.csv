https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ajaajvK39zQ,Playlist,4794,Pärt: Choral and Organ Music (Full Album),"Tracklist Below: Download via iTunes: https://itunes.apple.com/album/arvo-part-organ-choral-music/id1036814445 Buy CD: http://brilliantclassics.com/articles/p/paert-choral-and-organ-music/ Listen via Spotify: https://open.spotify.com/album/6jkNiHFRR96Oi9GSaELeu9  Arvo Pärt’s music resists the easily achieved peace of much Minimalist music of its time, even if its economy of gesture and expression – the joy taken in apparently simple beauty – has made him one of the iconic composers of our time. Such beauty is not simply achieved, and Pärt has written slowly, again unlike many of his contemporaries, filling each new piece with quiet quirks of harmony and unexpected turns that make them as satisfying to perform as they are to hear.  All the works on this album of music reflecting Pärt’s deep Christian faith derive from the ‘tintinnabuli’ style which he created in the 1970s, in rebellion from an earlier embrace of Modernism. In Cantate Domino (1978), a simple melodic voice embraced by an accompaniment taken from the tonic triad – the bell-like sound inspiring the label. In the Berliner-Messe of 1990 there are certainly many moments of ascetic detachment but these are balanced with a compelling range of emotion: originally written with string parts, the Mass is here performed as it would more commonly be heard in a liturgical context, with organ accompaniment. The organ plays a central role in The Beatitudes (199X): granite slabs of sound come into focus over unyielding pedal notes, the message intensified in the silences. Intensity rises with pitch until the music is torn apart by the organ at the concluding Amen.  Spiegel im Spiegel is a Pärt classic for its ineffable and seemingly inevitable progression, and makes no less haunting an effect than the violin-and-piano original in this arrangement for organ made in 2010. The other organ works are more imposing: Annum per annum, Trivium and Pari intervallo, all making full use of the Klais-restored organ of Leeds Cathedral.  The cathedral’s musicians have made several well-received recordings for Brilliant Classics, of music by Maurice Duruflé (9264), Hendrik Andriessen (94958), Georgi Mushel (9279) and others. Of the Durufle, Gramophone’s reviewer wrote: ‘Leeds Cathedral Choir…bright tone and honest, natural singing deliver very accomplished and satisfying performances. The choir are ably supported by the splendid accompaniments of the Skipton Camerata and organists Benjamin Saunders and Daniel Justin. It’s faithfully captured by the excellent recording… an enjoyable and rewarding two-CD set.’  As follow-up on their successful Duruflé recording (BC 9264) the splendid Leeds Cathedral Choir, conductor Benjamin Saunders and organist Felix Justin present choral and organ music by Arvo Pärt, the iconic Estonian master of New Spirituality. Included are the popular Berliner Messe, the Beatitudes, the complete organ works and Pärt’s most famous work, Spiegel im Spiegel, here played on the organ. Recorded in the spacious and generous acoustics of Leeds Cathedral, also featuring its magnificent organ. Booklet contains excellent liner notes, as well as the sung texts and the English translation, plus biographies of the artists.   00:00:00 The Beatitudes 00:07:49 Berliner Messe: I.

It's become something of a friendship now and I think it's safe to say you can expect a lot more of these collaborative mixes between these two channels. For this mix we wanted to make something sexy. A Throwback to those days of Cinemax and Traci Lords, Weird Science and all those other kinda, but not terribly smutty things of the 80's.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eDCohREvG0,Playlist,4438,Penguin Cafe Orchestra - Union Cafe (1993) [FULL ALBUM HQ].wmv,"[THE BAND] The Penguin Café Orchestra are a British classical ensemble formed in 1974 by Simon Jeffes (a guitar student at the Royal Academy) aiming to play ethnic music with the austerity of Western chamber music and the decadent languor of the café-concerto. The sound of this orchestra is fatuous and elegant, unaffected by the turmoil of modern life. Their music is as abstract as it is concrete: cabaret and ethnic folk elements are injected into baroque and renaissance music skeletons. Old-fashioned, nostalgic, theatrical and lofty, calligraphic but never parodistic, this exercise in revival aims to rebuild an atmosphere (the one of bourgeois families from the end of past century strolling to the city centre on Sundays) more than a sound. Every composition is a synthesis of music from certain period and exotic arrangements. From http://www.scaruffi.com/vol3/penguin.html  [TRACKLIST] 1) Scherzo And Trio (00:00) 2) Lifeboat (Lovers Rock) (06:55) 3) Nothing Really Blue (14:10) 4) Cage Dead (19:26) 5) Vega (24:05) 6) Yodel 3 (34:34) 7) Organum (38:00) 8) Another One From Porlock (41:49) 9) Thorn Tree Wind (44:46) 10) Silver Star Of Bologna (48:10) 11) Discover America (52:07) 12) Pythagoras On The Line (55:11) 13) Kora Kora (57:06) 14) Lie Back And Think Of England (1:00:12) 15) Red Shorts (1:04:28) 16) Passing Through (1:08:38)",

The album throws the listener far away to a musical experience in the style of the early years of the mushroom. Contaminated from beginning to end, the album glorifies the three-dimensional sound signature of the duo, along with multi-layered melodies and riding on an aggressive baseline galloping ahead with full power.  The result is a terrifying and unrestrained experience.

I feel that any song, new or old, that reminds me of my days playing these games are perfectly suited to put into a "" Zeldawave""  video. If you disagree, that is perfectly fine. I have even made a Zelda-only video if that's what you like. However, please stop reminding me that certain songs "" aren't Zelda""  when to me it doesn't matter at all.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZIQs-xoPPI,Playlist,3500,Classic Dubstep 2004-2007 - Vinyl Only Mix,A vinyl only Dubstep mix I recorded containing a selection of classic tunes from the genre's early days. I wasn't really going for great blends or trying to build up the energy level. Think of this as mainly a showcase of some of my favorite tunes from an incredible time in music history.  Tracklist: Skream - Midnight Request Line (Tempa - 2005) Toasty - Like Sun (Hotflush Recordings - 2004) Gatekeeper - Tomb (Skull Disco - 2006) Loefah - Rufage (DMZ - 2006) Distance - Empire (Hotflush Recordings - 2005) Mala - Lean Forward (DMZ - 2007) Cyrus - Bounty (Tectonic - 2006) Loefah & Skream - 28g (Tectonic - 2005) Loefah - The Goat Stare (DMZ - 2005) Distance - Dark Crystal (Boka - 2005) Shackleton - Blood On My Hands (Skull Disco - 2006) Kromestar - Marz Attak (Deep Medi Musik - 2007) Mala - Changes (Deep Medi Musik - 2007) Digital Mystikz - Misty Winter (Soul Jazz - 2006) Coki - The End (DMZ - 2007) Mala - Forgive (Deep Medi Musik - 2007)  I'd love to make this more of a regular thing.

There is something about the passage of time, and the exploration of the past that is fascinating. To uncover relics forgotten, to awaken slumbering gods, or loot golden coins with stamps in undecipherable languages.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1E7tz0zRlpE,Playlist,3217,Low Roar - Low Roar (Full Album),"Low Roar is a response to the unknown; a vivid portrait of those life-altering moments stained with equal parts hope and melancholy. Project of Ryan Karazija, Low Roar is the incarnation of change, atmosphere, and loneliness after a move from San Francisco, California to Reykjavík, Iceland. His self-titled emotive, twelve song debut chronicles the challenges of starting anew in a foreign land and is an honest depiction of the struggles to acclimate, find work, and support his family in the Icelandic winter. The album's opening lyrics "" I won't wake a wealthy man someday, 'cause the sun don't follow me""  begin to tell Low Roar's story.  Artist: Ryan Karazija Album: Low Roar Year: 2011 Songs: 1. Give Up 0:00 2. Just a Habit 03:06 3. Nobody Else 06:36 4. Patience 11:36 5. Low Roar 17:18 6. Friends Make Garbage (Good Friends Take It Out) 19:42 7. The Painter 25:12 8. Help Me 30:00 9.

While all pieces were written in 1988, some were written for a staging of Metamorphosis, while others were for a documentary film called The Thin Blue Line directed by Errol Morris. "" Metamorphosis One""  is played in an episode of Battlestar Galactica by Kara "" Starbuck""  Thrace. Within the narrative, her father composed and performed the piece. It is also played in the series finale of Person of Interest, Return 0. "" Metamorphosis Two""  formed the basis of one of the main musical themes in the film The Hours. It is also the song that the American rock band Pearl Jam uses as their introduction music to concerts.",

I posted  this project with the desire to see people engaging in a musical journey by having to search out the songs in their entirety. I also had quite a few previous videos containing Classical music taken down under copyright laws. After looking up these laws I noticed that one may simply provide most of the song without the ending and be able to get away with it. So I hope you enjoy this work and then go out and either buy or download the original music that I have presented here.  Paintings are by Claude Monet.  Music to elevate the soul and exult the divine.These are foretastes of late France's exuberant Impressionist Composers such as Maurice Ravel, along with Erik Satie, followed by Camile Saint Saens, in close suit Gabriel Faure and no other but the painter of sound; Claude Debussy.  This presentation is graced by the French Impressionist Artist hallowed as Claude Monet, who painted using an array of rich colors during the same time that Mr. Debussy was bent over his mysterious piano.  here is the necessary composition guide: Musical pieces:   0:00 Clare de Lune (Claude Debussy) 1:50 Estampes Pago (Claude Debussy) 3:36 The Snow is Falling (Claude Debussy) 5:52 Preludes Voiles (Claude Debussy) 7:10 Estampes la Soriee (Claude Debussy) 9:00 Gymnopedie 1 - Lent et Douloureux (Erik Satie) 10:48 Gnossienne 1 - Alessio Nanni (Erik Satie) 12:34 Nocturne no. 1 (Erik Satie) 14:24 Ma Mere l'Oye Pavane Belle (Maurice Ravel) 16:13 Ma Mere l'Oye Apotheose (Maurice Ravel) 18:01 Une Barque sur l'Ocean (Maurice Ravel) 19:50 Piano Concerto No. 3 (Saint Saens) 21:39 The Bird House (Saint Saens) 22:47 The Swan (Saint Saens) 24:37 Apres un Reve (Gabriel Faure)",

All nine parts of Shine On You Crazy Diamond, which is one of the greatest pieces of music made. This composition was a tribute to former band member, Syd Barrett. Written and performed by Roger Waters, David Gilmour and Richard Wright. From the album "" Wish You Were Here"" .  Lyrics: (Parts I-V) Remember when you were young, you shone like the sun. Shine on you crazy diamond. Now there's a look in your eyes, like black holes in the sky. Shine on you crazy diamond. You were caught on the crossfire of childhood and stardom, blown on the steel breeze. Come on you target for faraway laughter, come on you stranger, you legend, you martyr, and shine! You reached for the secret too soon, you cried for the moon. Shine on you crazy diamond. Threatened by shadows at night, and exposed in the light. Shine on you crazy diamond. Well you wore out your welcome with random precision, rode on the steel breeze. Come on you raver, you seer of visions, come on you painter, you piper, you prisoner, and shine! (Parts VI-IX) Nobody knows where you are, how near or how far. Shine on you crazy diamond. Pile on many more layers and I'll be joining you there. Shine on you crazy diamond. And we'll bask in the shadow of yesterday's triumph, sail on the steel breeze. Come on you boy child, you winner and loser, come on you miner for truth and delusion, and shine.",

I waited a long time to do this, as I knew it would be a huge undertaking.  I've been documenting my work/progress, and will be uploading an hour long video showing this monster being creating.  In this remix/arrangement, I attempted to tell a story, following Link through Hyrule.  It doesn't play the themes necessarily in the order the player would hear them, but I wanted this order, as the themes flow together very nicely.  Of the 28 tracks I arranged, I have a few personal favorite sections; in no particular order, they're Goron City, Medalion Get, Lost Woods, Forest Temple, Zora's Domain, Lakeside Lab, Kakariko Village and Zelda's Lullaby.  By all means, please tell me your own favorites.  This thing is my baby and I think several pieces of me went into this.  If you liked, please subscribe, as I'm planning on doing (and have already created) many, many more medleys like this one.  More medleys for Zelda are planned (as well as other games I often mention) including Wind Waker, A Link to the Past and possibly Link's Awakening.  🍨 Buy me an ice cream: https://ko-fi.com/rebeccaetripp  Here's a list of all the tracks included in this medley:  Open Treasure Box Spiritual Stone Get/Light Arrows Castle Courtyard Market Lon Lon Ranch/Epona's Song Hyrule Field Goron City Kaepora Gaebora Twinrova Gerudo Valley Ganon's Theme Inside Jabu Jabu's Belly Lake Side Laboratory/Magic Potion Shop Spirit Temple Words of the Deku Tree Forest Temple Temple of Time/Song of Time Chamber of The Sages Zora's Domain Kakariko Village Princess Zeldaís Theme/Zeldaís Lullaby Title Theme/Opening Screen Medallion Get Kokiri Forest Lost Woods/Saria's Song Windmill Hut/Song of Storms Fairy Fountain/The Great Faery Sheik's Theme  Here are some of my other Zelda medleys:  Majora's Mask Epic Orchestral Medley: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Csj2K-jD25Y&list=PLhsnNwoLVWWNhgWEy1zm7_-HqnEg7q3CN Various Town Themes Celtic Medley: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8V2pKFz_F0&list=PLhsnNwoLVWWNhgWEy1zm7_-HqnEg7q3CN Epic Overworld Themes Medley: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pW6l7UKdvBc&list=PLhsnNwoLVWWNhgWEy1zm7_-HqnEg7q3CN Skyward Sword Goddess Songs Medley: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSYPHyBsHpc&list=PLhsnNwoLVWWNhgWEy1zm7_-HqnEg7q3CN  Link to every VGM remix I've ever created (there is an absurdly high number): https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLhsnNwoLVWWON9zRaW-KZKRwBHKeLZ_V7  Link to my FB fan page: https://www.facebook.com/CrystalEchoSound Link to my Twitter: https://twitter.com/EvokeSeagull  Here is my personal website: http://www.crystalechosound.com/",

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Csj2K-jD25Y,Playlist,961,Majora's Mask Epic Orchestral Medley,"Download high quality version here: https://rebeccatripp.bandcamp.com/track/Majoras-Mask-Epic-Orchestral-Medley  This is my Majora's Mask Epic Orchestral Medley.  I've had this planned for quite some time now!  Mostly, I've been working on long Final Fantasy medleys, but I felt it was time to deviate from my usual routine and create a Legend of Zelda one.  How do you like it?  I put every single ounce of love, care, attention and passion into this one.  (I even worked on it on my birthday!) In a way, this medley tells a story.  It starts out with the intro music, where Link is traveling in the forest, just before he meets Skullkid.  It then transitions into the song of Healing, representing his journey to get his humanity back and his first steps into Termina.  Following this, it deals with the lore, strife, mystery and danger all over the land, right up until the final moments before the moon falls, during which, the song becomes very somber indeed.  As I composed that part (Final Hour) I thought to myself "" Everyone dies- even I am going to die!""  as chilling waves of existential dread washed over me.  After this, I transitioned the arrangement into the Astral Observatory melody (which I hope will be comforting), thinking to myself "" Human lives are not eternal, but there is a vast universe out there- something much bigger and, perhaps, transcendental and even meaningful to contemplate.""   I followed this with the reunion music, thinking to myself that, maybe, there can only really be one eternal thing- something which transcends both time and space.  "" Perhaps this thing is love?""  I thought to myself as I slaved away at the computer.  The Clock Tower theme followed this, closing the loop the Song of Healing began, now wizened and ethereal, utilizing choral singing, Tibetan chants and chimes: a fitting theme for the Happy Mask Man, in my opinion.  Perhaps he is immortal in some way.  Perhaps he knows everything we (and Link + the residents of Termina) can't know.  After this, the song of time, the Sun's Song and Termina Field represent rebirth; they also represent the presence of Link, whose Triforce of Courage allows the player to defeat their greatest enemies, conquer their fears and revisit the past.  🍨 Buy me an ice cream: https://ko-fi.com/rebeccaetripp  Here is a list of all of the tracks included in this medley:  Opening Scene Song of Healing Elegy of Emptiness Oath to Order Deku Palace Stone Tower Temple Kamaro's Dance (with elements of Majora's Theme) Woodfall Swamp Clock Town (Day 2 with elements of Day 3) Final Hour/Last End Astral Observatory Tatl and Tael Reunited Clock Tower Song of Time Sun's Song Termina Field  Note: I do not own any of the images I used in this video!

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_fuIMye31Gw,Playlist,945,Erik Satie - Gymnopédies,"Erik Satie - Gymnopédie No.1  Satie was introduced as a "" gymnopedist""  in 1887, shortly before writing his most famous compositions, the Gymnopédies. Later, he also referred to himself as a "" phonometrograph""  or "" phonometrician""  (meaning "" someone who measures (and writes down) sounds"" ) preferring this designation to that of "" musician,""  after having been called "" a clumsy but subtle technician""  in a book on contemporary French composers published in 1911.  Éric Alfred Leslie Satie (French: [eʁik sati];[1] 17 May 1866 – 1 July 1925), who signed his name Erik Satie after 1884, was a French composer and pianist. Satie was an influential artist in the late 19th- and early 20th-century Parisian avant-garde. His work was a precursor to later artistic movements such as minimalism, repetitive music, and the Theatre of the Absurd  Satie was a colourful figure in the early 20th century Parisian avant-garde. He was a precursor to later artistic movements such as minimalism, repetitive music and the Theatre of the Absurd. The Gymnopédies, published in Paris starting in 1888, are three piano compositions written by French composer and pianist, Erik Satie.  Since 1911 he had been on friendly terms with Igor Stravinsky, about whom he would later write articles.Le piège de Méduse (1913) had a unique position in Satie's oeuvre, as it was a stage work conceived and composed seemingly without any collaboration with other artists.Sports et divertissements was a kind of multi-media project, in which Satie provided piano music to drawings made by Charles Martin. The work was composed in 1914, but not published or performed until the early 1920s. The individual pieces are characteristic Satie "" miniatures"" : in all, there are twenty pieces - none over two minutes in length, and some as short as 15 seconds.He got in trouble over an insulting postcard he had written to one of his critics shortly after the premiere of Parade; he was condemned to a week of imprisonment, but was finally released as a result of the (financial) intercession of Winnaretta Singer, Princess Edmond de Polignac.Singer, who had learnt Ancient Greek when she was over 50, had commissioned a work on Socrates in October 1916; this would become his Socrate, which he presented early in 1918 to the Princess.  - Gymmopedie No. 1. - Gnossienne No. 1 - Gnossienne No. 3 -GnossienneNo. 4 - Gnossienne No. 2  Édouard Cortès's paintings.",

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WbK1GTY3BUA,Song,689,Lauge - Vandringen [SpaceAmbient],"📡 The duo Lauge & Baba Gnohm consists of Henrik Laugesen and Kalle Christensen, both born in 1985 in Denmark. They first met in 2008 in Christiania. After a successful day in the studio, they decided to put their previous solo projects on hold, and team up. Lauge & Baba Gnohm was formed in the late winter of 2008, and that wintery feeling which was present in their first tracks, still leave traces in their more recent soundscapes. Henrik and Kalle are heavily inspired by nature, especially the arctic parts of the world. Till now Lauge & Baba Gnohm have had many releases on various labels around the globe, as well as being part of a sync company dealing with soundtracks for movies and documentaries. The very first Lauge & Baba Gnohm collaboration release was The Perfect Stranger which was released on the German record label Blue Tunes Records. Along with releases on different compilations, Lauge & Baba Gnohm have released two EPs: Daybreak, on Soundmute, and Monolith, on Chillbase and the full-length album "" Langbortistan""  on Altar Records.  ☄️ Download: https://laugebabagnohm.bandcamp.com/  Spotify: Lauge & Baba Gnohm: https://open.spotify.com/artist/7HPB7nqnx5kx1wIhFiHZ3M Lauge: https://open.spotify.com/artist/72Syhg4FIEracKDa3yumQY  🌌 Lauge & Baba Gnohm Websites: https://www.facebook.com/LaugeBabaGnohm/ https://www.facebook.com/LaugeChill/ https://www.facebook.com/GnOhm-205895126206313/ https://soundcloud.com/laugebabagnohm https://soundcloud.com/gnohmbaba https://soundcloud.com/user-219427456 https://www.last.fm/music/Lauge+&+Baba+Gnohm https://www.mixcloud.com/henrik-laugesen/  🤖 SpaceAmbient. https://www.facebook.com/SpaceAmbient/ https://twitter.com/SpaceAmbient1 https://www.patreon.com/SpaceAmbient  🛰️ All music on SpaceAmbient channel is used to promote indie artists.

Official Store: http://po.st/sajiZS, iTunes: http://po.st/LZdZ8Q, GooglePlay: http://po.st/E1IeUV Have a go at performing Einaudi yourself at http://po.st/EinaudiNightExclusive  Groundbreaking composer and pianist Ludovico Einaudi – whose unique musical style is renowned around the world – returns with a new album ‘Elements’. Recorded at Einaudi’s Italian home, ‘Elements’ features 12 tracks, which interweave piano, strings, percussion, guitar and electronica and it is simultaneously exhilarating and transcendent. It is inspired by nature’s elements, mathematical and scientific elements, musical forms and works of art.  Says Einaudi: “I saw new frontiers – on the edge between what I knew and what I didn’t know – that I had long wanted to explore: creation myths, the periodic table, Euclid's geometry, Kandinsky’s writings, the matter of sound, and of colour, the stems of wild grass in a meadow, the shapes of the landscape. For months I wandered in a seemingly chaotic mix of images, thoughts and feelings. Then, gradually, everything came together in a dance, as if all the elements were parts of the same world, and myself within it.”     #LudovicoEinaudi #Elements #Vevo",

If I call on every soul in the land, on the moon Tell me if I'll ever know a blessing in disguise  The curse ruled from the underground down by the shore And their hope grew with a hunger to live unlike before And the curse ruled from the underground down by the shore And their hope grew with a hunger to live unlike before",

Sometimes when you're scared to take a look At the corner of the room You've sensed that something's watching you  Have you ever been alone at night Thought you heard footsteps behind And turned around and no-one's there? And as you quicken up your pace You find it hard to look again Because you're sure there's someone there  Watching horror films the night before Debating witches and folklore The unknown troubles on your mind Maybe your mind is playing tricks You sense, and suddenly eyes fix on dancing shadows from behind  Fear of the dark, fear of the dark I have constant fear that something's always near Fear of the dark, fear of the dark I have a phobia that someone's always there  When I'm walking a dark road I am a man who walks alone...",

The shows were among my favorite club experiences ever - and to see you all embrace the concept and make those shows so incredible was one of the proudest moments of my career. I truly feel that we developed a connection with music and each other that needs to be built upon and nurtured.  I've had a little dream of doing a series of extended daytime events since we launched the TNH concept. So, this summer, we are excited to bring TNH back, with a twist, for the Summer Gatherings - three extended daytime parties in three unique locations with an extra focus on positivity, character and atmosphere.  I’ve always felt there’s a special magic that comes together at the best daytime events, so my team and I have been searching high and low for locations that have that unique and positive vibe. I'm really excited to announce the first three - the stunning outdoor Mishawaka Amphitheatre in Colorado, the outdoor courtyard of The Well in Brooklyn and an amazing warehouse space in San Francisco.  Each has its own unique character and vibe, and we’ll be putting in extra touches to make the events even more special.  We’re also changing the format of the events to create a more expanded musical journey. I'll start each of these shows with a 2 hour warmup set - then our special guest Luttrell will take over, before a 3 hour closing set from me.  I also wanted to share some new music as we announce these shows - and Little Voices was made with exactly this kind of show in mind. I've been closing a lot of my sets with this recently, hope you enjoy and hope to see you this summer :)  Love, Daniel  Subscribe: http://po.st/ytlane8music  Follow Lane 8: Website: http://www.lane8music.com Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/lane8music Twitter: https://twitter.com/lane8music Spotify: http://po.st/sLane8 Instagram: http://instagram.com/lane8music SoundCloud: https://soundcloud.com/lane8music",

And just as El Gitano, this release features very differential remixes for house music lovers of all kinds: The two label managers Greg Silver and Chico Chiquita added a rougher electro-driven remix, typical for their pumping house sound as DJs. The second remix comes from the young but extremely gifted Kevin Over from Germanys Ruhr-Area. Kevin adds some deeper, but very funky grooves to Café Prague and will gain the friendship of many tech-house and Mannheim-House lovers...",

Yeah, who are you? Yeah, who are you? Yeah, who are you?  Keep you in the dark You know they all pretend  [Chorus x2]  [x2] What if I say I'm not like the others?

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lt0Ji14Zkyk,Song,361,Hammock - Sinking Inside Yourself,"Fan-made video for the song ''Sinking Inside Yourself'', originally performed by Hammock, taken from the ''Asleep In The Downlights'' EP (2011).  Hammock is an American two-member post-rock band from Nashville, Tennessee. With music created in between production and songwriting projects over the course of two years, Hammock combines live instrumentation, electronic beats, and droning guitar into atmospheric music similar in style to the work of Boards of Canada, Explosions in the Sky, and Stars of the Lid.  Lyrics:  Every time you wake up, Too gone to see.  Every time you come down, So far from me.  Next time when you wake up, You're lost at sea.  I just watch you sink down, And fade away from me.  Where do you go, When the life slips from your eyes?  I'll never know, Why you smiled and waved goodbye.  Where do you go, When the life slips from your eyes?  I'll never know, Why you smiled and waved goodbye.",

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf692zBUOac,Song,354,[Undertale Remix] SharaX - Megalotrousle,"~[Edit: iTunes, Spotify & More]~ Did you check itunes? A few songs are now available there! Some songs will show up on Spotify (and many other sites) in a couple of hours. I've been busy working to get all my Undertale remixes on there first, and more will show up over there quite soon, so dun worry if your favorite remix isn't on there yet o3o  I was very surprised no one else remixed Bonetrousle and Megalovania together in an epic remix, and I decided to solve the problem. So here you go, a remix masterpiece that took two weeks of working non-stop (and I'm working on a big project atm too, so that's why this remix took longer than usual) OvO  This song is one of the most technical remixes I've ever written, as I was trying to practice going from two extremities (Very hard tech to light orchestral) and also practice using various transitions throughout the entire piece. I was trying to see how far my skills could go, and I hope you enjoy! OwO  Also Tokyovania's in there, along with a short Cider vocal cameo at 3:11.

Listen here: http://smarturl.it/SleepingO_All ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- The official music video for "" Beggar in the Morning""  by The Barr Brothers, from the album The Barr Brothers (2011, Secret City Records). Directed by Sebastian Lange. Puppets by Stephan Bircher ( http://www.stephanbircher.com/). Produced by Opak Media.  "" The idea for the Beggar in the Morning video came after I met the artist Stephan Bircher in British Columbia. A friend of mine was sharing an art opening with him. The next day I went out to his studio and was introduced to this wonderful dark and playful world of his imagination -- objects from the natural world - bones, shells, skulls - reused and redefined with rusty old machine parts. With the flick of a switch, it all comes to life. I always thought that a video would be the best way for people to see his work, since its very involved and expensive for him to dismantle his figurines and set them up somewhere else. Ideally, this video is beneficial for both The Barr Brothers and Stephan, as I hope more people will be introduced to this very unique and imaginative artist. The director, Sebastien Lange had to travel to British Columbia to film the figurines as they cannot be transported...""  - Brad  Official site: http://www.thebarrbrothers.com On Facebook: http://www.facebook.com/thebarrbrothers On Twitter: http://www.twitter.com/thebarrbrothers On iTunes: http://itunes.apple.com/us/album/the-...

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ksv_blsfKU,Song,348,Juno's Touch - Constellation Conversation (Music Video),"This is a song I wrote about the past 13 years of my life attending school. It's about graduating high school and beginning something new. It reflects on the past and remembers who I spent it with. I could never quite grasp the idea of graduating. People I'd see everyday for years and years would suddenly just vanish when the last day of school came. Change and closure have always been my best friend and my biggest enemy. This song was my closure. The lyrics are in call and response form. The male voice, me, representing me. The female voice represents those I grew up with, whether they were best friends, or hallway acquaintances.  Authenticity was very important to me with this project. All the extras were people I grew up with and went to high school with. The mystery girl is one of my best friends, who I've known since preschool. The school scenes were filmed at my actual high school. The band scene was filmed at the first venue I ever played at. The home videos are my actual home videos footage. I wanted to recreate the time I had in school, as it was a period of my life I'll never forget.  Video Production:  Directed by Isaac Winkler Production Assistance by Philip Rabalais Concept by Isaac Winkler & Juno's Touch Edited by Isaac Winkler Lighting (4:15 - 5:23) done by Bryan Prather-Huff  Lots of love to the cast involved in this project.",

No, no, no, we just keep going Write a new song, craft another great poem And then you broadcast, shoot it through they hard glass Hook 'em with the single then you hit 'em with the star clash Know what that is? That's your best move Make the crowd roar, get the one, two, three, count Pin they shoulders to the mat now Raise your title to the ceiling, really watch 'em clap loud Now they ring the bell, hatin' cause you feeling well Climbing to my citadel, shooting all my sentinels—BOOM!  (Pre-chorus) I said BOOM! (x2)  (Chorus) We taking off, we driving it all night We'll be flying away We taking off, we driving it all night We'll be flying away  (Verse 2) I like to paint thoughts, in a song form They like to twist words, make me conform Make me feel like I am trapped up in a box Every single that I drop, it ain't ever gonna stop, no! 'Cause I'm lovin all the energy Call it what you will, but I call it versatility I really like my jazz and I dig rock too I dig a Rocky Johnson and Fatu Independent but I'm sent to intervent it In the main event I win it like a Undertaker finish And I got to take a minute, words is my melody Write another verse just to work through telepathy I fell before so I remember how that feel like Don't it feel like you was dreaming, is this real life? This is real as a knife that'll cut my mic off And we all love to glow so turn the lights off—HEY!  (Pre-chorus) I said HEY! (x2)  [Chorus]  (Verse 3) We on verse 3, you get the song yet? You want the highly profound with the soul flip? In a bold step I will fold any old texts Claiming they a legend but they hidden just like Olmec! Yeah, we bringing life to the radio Take it to the station to the pavement just to play me though They call it underground, we call it underrated A bunch of talented people who really could've made it But that's the fabric in the blanket of our culture Cop a couple Lamborghini's then you're over I copped my own ship, I fly it to the moon I get to see the world and maybe see ya soon So we can grip the mic and lighten up the dance floor Have 'em throw they arms around until we see they hands sore Now they ring the bell, hatin' 'cause you feeling well Climbing to my citadel, shooting all my sentinels—BOOM!  I said Boom! (x2)  [Chorus]",

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=heHc41h47I8,Song,330,Pirates of the Caribbean (Froto Remix),"Although the first movie came out over 10 years ago and the last one in 2011, I decided to make a remix to this famous theme song from Disney's Pirates of the Caribbean and treat it with a big room sound.  I was originally inspired by the song Tsunami by DVBBS & Borgeous because it gave off a great naval vibe and I thought it would interesting to mash it up with the Pirate's theme.  However, after experimenting with a direct mash-up I found out that it actually didn't work so I decided instead to construct a remix from scratch.  Hence after working on this track throughout winter break, this remix was born! Elements include a naval battle vibe as well as  I also wanted to incorporating imagery of large boat party where perhaps the pirates are celebrating a recent victory.  The Jack Sparrow sample should also be instantly recognizable.  This remix includes mix in points both in the beginning and end so DJ's can easily incorporate this song into their set.  Dancers in the crowd should recognize that familiar pirate melody and get right into it.  Hope you guys enjoy this track, if you have any questions hit me up at:  Facebook: http://www.faceook.com/djfroto Twitter: http://www.twitter.com/djfroto Youtube Channel: http://www.youtube.com/djfroto Soundcloud: http://soundcloud.com/djfrotoofficial Mixcloud: http://www.mixcloud.com/djfroto  You can use this song for your own videos as long as you credit the artist.

The world as you know it has fallen apart, it is but here in the afterlife you might find comfort, if you can find her, you have to. The city mourns with you as the fog rolls in over rusted docks. Shadows crawl across boarded up windows and dilapidated store fronts. Empty streets and frozen winds echo in the void and in your orphaned soul. You were loved once but now walk alone, drifting slowly with a heartache that shatters worlds.  Using synths, drones, live instruments and field recordings, the album takes us on a journey that's both dreamy and harrowing. Recommended for fans of emotional piano movements and the foggy atmospheres of Silent Hill.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FveFmShXoRE,Song,321,(Breaking Bad) Walt & Jesse || TIME,"*1080p for Best Quality*  MAJOR SPOILERS INCLUDED FOR THE ENTIRE SERIES OF BREAKING BAD  https://twitter.com/aaronpaul_8/status/664863594794901508  This is my entry for contest I've been involved with for a while. My group's April category was focused on enemy/rivaly relationships, so I chose one of my favorite dynamics in all of television.... Walt & Jesse. It's amazing how this video is 5 1/2 minutes long but I still feel like I barely scratched the surface of these two characters.  I ended up focusing the video mostly from Jesse's point of view, so it might also serve as a bit of a Jesse character study if you'd like to view it that way.  Hope you guys enjoy!

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjZy4bymvvk,Song,317,Johannes Brahms - Intermezzo Op. 117 No. 1 in E flat major,"The 3 Intermezzi Op. 117 were composed in 1892 and are among the best-loved and most popular of Brahms' autumnal late piano output. On a smaller and more intimate scale than the surrounding sets of Op. 116, Op. 118 and Op. 119, the composer described these pieces as "" lullabies to my sorrows"" . Here we find Brahms at his most tender and introspective, with only one outburst (in the third Intermezzo) of the characteristic Brahmsian fieryness. The Intermezzi were inspired by a Scottish poem from Herder's Volkslieder, and bear this inscription:  Schlaf sanft mein Kind, schlaf sanft und Schön! Mich dauert's sehr, dich weinen sehn.  Sleep softly my child, sleep softly and well! It hurts my heart to see you weeping.  Piano: Idil Biret  Picture: Winter, Close of Day by George Inness",

Lunatic Soul is the solo project from Mariusz Duda , the creative force, lead singer and talented multi-instrumentalist behind Poland's Progressive Rock shooting stars Riverside.  "" Walking On A Flashlight Beam - the title indicates living in a world of imagination, in a place that's made up and unreal. You can have your head in the clouds, you can chase after rainbows so you can walk on a flashlight beam too. It's a story about choosing to be alone, inspired by the life of people who were completely alienated and withdrawn from social life, who shunned all interactions with the outside world. It's about people who, even on a bright and sunny day, have the curtains drawn and the blinds closed in their rooms. Such people are usually surrounded by books, films, games, figments of other people's imagination. I've written about solitude and living in a world of fiction before in Riverside's lyrics but now I've decided to write a whole album about it.""   ‘Walking On A Flashlight Beam’ is the fourth album from Lunatic Soul and follow up to  2011’s acclaimed ‘Impressions’ album and comprises of almost 64 minutes of brand new music. Commenting on his new opus  Duda says  “These are very dark and intense compositions but very melodious too. I think it’s one of the best things I’ve ever written, if not the best one”. The first single & video due to be taken from the new album will be for the track ‘Cold’. As with previous Lunatic Soul albums artwork was created by the renowned cover artist Travis Smith who has previous created covers for the likes of Opeth & Riverside.  ‘Walking On A Flashlight Beam’ is available as a 2 disc media book featuring a 25 minute bonus disc of interview footage entitled ‘In Between’, which plots the creative course Mariusz Dada takes between working in Riverside to his solo work in Lunatic Soul.

In their own special way. All that you rely on And all that you can fake Will leave you in the morning But find you in the day  Oh you're in my veins And I cannot get you out Oh you're all I taste At night inside of my mouth Oh you run away Cause I am not what you found Oh you're in my veins And I cannot get you out.  Everything will change. Nothin stays the same. And nobody here's perfect. Oh but everyones to blame All that you rely on And all that you can save Will leave you in the morning And find you in the day  Oh you're in my veins And I cannot get you out Oh you're all I taste At night inside of my mouth Oh you run away Cause I am not what you found Oh you're in my veins And I cannot get you out.  No I cannot get you out. No I cannot get you.  Everything is dark. It's more than you can take. But you catch a glimpse of sun light. Shinin, down on your face.  Oh you're in my veins And I cannot get you out Oh you're all I taste At night inside of my mouth Oh you run away Cause I am not what you found Oh you're in my veins And I cannot get you out.",

Additional editing by Kat Marsh. Original footage from 'Berserk'.  GUNSHIP has been described as a neon soaked, late night, sonic getaway drive, dripping with analog synthesizers, cinematic vocals and cyberpunk values, all exploding from the front cover of a dusty plastic VHS case which has lain forgotten since 1984.  Lyrics:  Peace at last The abyss laughs when I tell it I'm ready  Steal the rhythm out from my heart Your bloody hands will make a perfect start Black sun on the horizon Turning tricks to tear our senses apart...  ...And I like it  It's just a little frightening To lose everything at once  Steal the rhythm out from my heart Your bloody hands will make a perfect start Black sun on the horizon Turning tricks to tear our senses apart...  ...And I like it  Into the sun all memory return Spirit bombs explode Are you ready to know everything  Believe it, believe it, we will become one Let it go with your soul  Steal the rhythm out from my heart Steal the rhythm out from my heart",

''Chopin - Spring Waltz'' is just a pseudonym. Chopin hasn't written this piece. I uploaded this piece when I, just like you, didn't know the truth that this piece is not by Chopin! But... Unfortunately, if I'll change the name of this video to the correct one, other videos with name "" Chopin Spring Waltz""  will rise on top(there's hundreds of them!), so I put this disclaimer on top of description of the most popular video. I truly didn't want to pour misinformation around.

Is it because I can't be her made your mistakes and make me hurt I can't fix you Is it because I can't be her made me awake and make me hurt I can't fix you   I can feel my heart breaking, mistakes I've been making I'm running out of patience to pretend This isn't how I'll let it end, my feigning fading You've been mourning your loss here, and that's grinding my gears how can a human lose their self control theres nothing left to make you whole I'm done explaining   This is what happens when you leave it to someone else if you want it done right you should do it yourself You oversaturate your world with nothing but machines You might make everyone happy but you're dead just like me   and now we're here at a standstill I wonder if you feel the kind of pain that rips your insides out? that's something I know all about, shocking, ain't it? We have a lot more in common than you would be calm with It's like we're the same person, me and you We both don't know we can do....  #fnaf #fivenightsatfreddys", 
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D75gNwik4jY,Song,306,Luke O'Brien - Old Love,"iTunes: http://bit.ly/OLDLOVE Spotify: http://bit.ly/OldLoveSpotify  I used this song to propose to my high school sweetheart, and now wife; Kathleen O'Brien. In all the time that we've known each other, we've shot countless music videos together. She is also my DJ (DJ Leen) for my live performances from time to time. It only made sense that we shoot the official music video on our wedding day. The fact that this video is what it is, is exactly why I married the girl in this video. She loves me and my art and she supports me in whatever I embark on. We hope you enjoy watching this video as much as we enjoyed making it!

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_L9RUBjomjM,Song,295,Lauge - Fjeld [SpaceAmbient],"📡 The duo Lauge & Baba Gnohm consists of Henrik Laugesen and Kalle Christensen, both born in 1985 in Denmark. They first met in 2008 in Christiania. After a successful day in the studio, they decided to put their previous solo projects on hold, and team up. Lauge & Baba Gnohm was formed in the late winter of 2008, and that wintery feeling which was present in their first tracks, still leave traces in their more recent soundscapes. Henrik and Kalle are heavily inspired by nature, especially the arctic parts of the world. Till now Lauge & Baba Gnohm have had many releases on various labels around the globe, as well as being part of a sync company dealing with soundtracks for movies and documentaries. The very first Lauge & Baba Gnohm collaboration release was The Perfect Stranger which was released on the German record label Blue Tunes Records. Along with releases on different compilations, Lauge & Baba Gnohm have released two EPs: Daybreak, on Soundmute, and Monolith, on Chillbase and the full-length album "" Langbortistan""  on Altar Records.  ☄️ Download: https://laugebabagnohm.bandcamp.com/  Spotify: Lauge & Baba Gnohm: https://open.spotify.com/artist/7HPB7nqnx5kx1wIhFiHZ3M Lauge: https://open.spotify.com/artist/72Syhg4FIEracKDa3yumQY  🌌 Lauge & Baba Gnohm Websites: https://www.facebook.com/LaugeBabaGnohm/ https://www.facebook.com/LaugeChill/ https://www.facebook.com/GnOhm-205895126206313/ https://soundcloud.com/laugebabagnohm https://soundcloud.com/gnohmbaba https://soundcloud.com/user-219427456 https://www.last.fm/music/Lauge+&+Baba+Gnohm https://www.mixcloud.com/henrik-laugesen/  🤖 SpaceAmbient. https://www.facebook.com/SpaceAmbient/ https://twitter.com/SpaceAmbient1 https://www.patreon.com/SpaceAmbient  🛰️ All music on SpaceAmbient channel is used to promote indie artists.

Oh could I be the sky on the fourth of July?  “Well you do enough talk My little hawk, why do you cry? Tell me what did you learn from the Tillamook burn? Or the Fourth of July? We’re all gonna die.”  Sitting at the bed with the halo at your head Was it all a disguise, like Junior High Where everything was fiction, future, and prediction Now where am I? My fading supply  “Did you get enough love, my little dove Why do you cry? And I’m sorry I left, but it was for the best Though it never felt right My little Versailles.”  The hospital asked should the body be cast Before I say goodbye, my star in the sky Such a funny thought to wrap you up in cloth Do you find it all right, my dragonfly?  “Shall we look at the moon, my little loon Why do you cry? Make the most of your life, while it is rife While it is light  Well you do enough talk My little hawk, why do you cry? Tell me what did you learn from the Tillamook burn? Or the Fourth of July? We’re all gonna die.”",Sufjan Stevens

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTeKpWp8Psw,Song,279,"Sufjan Stevens, "" Fourth Of July""  (Official Audio)","From the album CARRIE & LOWELL Buy it: http://akrec.co/akr099-buy / Album stream: http://akrec.co/1xuiuN0 Available on Asthmatic Kitty Records  More info: http://carrieandlowell.com  LYRICS: The evil it spread like a fever ahead It was night when you died, my firefly What could I have said to raise you from the dead? Oh could I be the sky on the fourth of July?  “Well you do enough talk My little hawk, why do you cry? Tell me what did you learn from the Tillamook burn? Or the Fourth of July? We’re all gonna die.”  Sitting at the bed with the halo at your head Was it all a disguise, like Junior High Where everything was fiction, future, and prediction Now where am I? My fading supply  “Did you get enough love, my little dove Why do you cry? And I’m sorry I left, but it was for the best Though it never felt right My little Versailles.”  The hospital asked should the body be cast Before I say goodbye, my star in the sky Such a funny thought to wrap you up in cloth Do you find it all right, my dragonfly?  “Shall we look at the moon, my little loon Why do you cry? Make the most of your life, while it is rife While it is light  Well you do enough talk My little hawk, why do you cry? Tell me what did you learn from the Tillamook burn? Or the Fourth of July? We’re all gonna die.”",

"" It has been incredibly emotional to work on this, and especially to watch it. I feel that by doing it, we not only faced some of our biggest fears, but it enabled us to use our talents to bring some light to people that need it. As we move forward to the Hollywood Bowl show and beyond, I think about the people that connect with the band, outside and inside our circle. This video is a gesture of good will to the people that want that connection.""  - JOE HAHN  "" One More Light was written with the intention of sending love to those who lost someone. We now find ourselves on the receiving end. In memorial events, art, videos, and images, fans all over the world have gravitated towards this song as their declaration of love and support for the band and the memory of our dear friend, Chester. We are so very grateful and can’t wait to see you again.""  - MIKE SHINODA  Visit http://chester.linkinpark.com  Download/Stream the new album 'One More Light' - http://lprk.co/onemorelight</a",

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9E6b3swbnWg,Song,269,Chopin - Nocturne op.9 No.2,"Nocturne in E-flat major, Op. 9, No. 2 Played by Vadim Chaimovich (https://www.youtube.com/vadimchaimovich) FB-Vadim: https://www.facebook.com/vadimchaimovich -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------  Instagram https://www.instagram.com/andrearomanoandrea  Vincent van Gogh painted The Starry Night one year before dying. Chopin composed his popular Nocturne when he was about twenty. it does not matter if you think that it is too late for you or that you still have a lot of time...you have to decide whether you are Chopin or van Gogh.  The idea behind these videos is coming from a research published by the Psychology Department of Berkeley University studying the relation between colors, emotions and how external stimuli are impacting decision making.  The study results demonstrate a strong correlation between faster music in minor tone and the choice from participants of colors from that were saturated, yellower and lighter whereas a slower and minor music produced the opposite pattern (choice of desaturated, darker and bluer colors).  Based on these findings, we wanted to create synesthesia in our videos and trigger more intense and long-lasting emotions in our viewers, get higher audience retention and interaction. We decided to do that by associating drawings from the major painters that were following the scientific findings of this research. The choice of these paintings and the consecutive association with the music is also based on an accurate work that requires significant time and energy.  The analysis of the melodies returned to us a lot of information on how the painting should have been made. We needed a simple blue pattern but with an intrinsic meaning. Something that people could watch for a while without really understand it.  By creating this video I tried to do only one thing which turned to be the most difficult one: make you feel an emotional synesthesia. When hearing the melody, don't you feel that everything is...blue? aren’t you lost in the sky? is your mind going over? It’s not for no reason. it is not only an image, it is not only a melody. It is a trip. You don't feel bored. Its your mind using the notes and the colors to create your own experience.  Most of the videos online with only one image are only music, but not this.  The research behind the perfect combination is the key for the unconscious.  The research: "" Music–color associations are mediated by emotion""  https://www.pnas.org/content/110/22/8836 Stephen E. Palmer, Karen B. Schloss, Zoe Xu, and Lilia R. Prado-León --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  This popular nocturne is in rounded binary form (A, A, B, A, B, A) with coda, C. The A and B sections become increasingly ornamented with each recurrence. The penultimate bar utilizes considerable rhythmic freedom, indicated by the instruction, senza tempo (without tempo). Nocturne in E-flat major opens with a legato melody, mostly played piano, containing graceful upward leaps which becomes increasingly wide as the line unfolds. This melody is heard again three times during the piece. With each repetition, it is varied by ever more elaborate decorative tones and trills. The nocturne also includes a subordinate melody, which is played with rubato.",

(Please click on 'CC' button or activate 'Interactive Transcript' function)  :: iTunes DL : https://itunes.apple.com/us/album/blockbuster/id571165868  They are finally back. During their gap, they thought deeply about the new album as a result they came up with the new album "" BLOCKBUSTER"" . Showcase will start October17th with online publishing and they will start from there.  There first regular album title "" NILLILI MAMBO""  has the concept of pirates. On the grand and fancy orchestra music there is hip-hop beat added to create the song 'NILLILI MAMO'. This song is selected since it can make people dance to it.  They only debuted about two years ago, but through their first album "" BLOCKBUSTER""  we hope that they can come back and reach the top this time.  ▶ LOENMUSIC FB : http://www.facebook.com/LOENMUSIC.official ▶ LOENMUSIC TW : https://twitter.com/LOEN_MUSIC  Block B(ブロック・ビー) _ NILLILI MAMBO(ニリリマンボ) MV 長い空白の時間を経て久しぶりに彼らが帰ってきた。 その間ブロック・ビーのメンバーたちが真剣に悩んで努力した結果の産物である彼らの１stフルアルバム[BLOCKBUSTER]がいよいよ姿を現す。 10月17日オンライン音源リリースを皮切りに、待ってくれたファンたちへの恩返しとしてショーケースを行って、本格的な活動を始める予定だ。  ブロック・ビーの１stフルアルバムのタイトル曲「ニリリマンボ」は、'海賊'というコンセプトで作った曲だ。勇壮で華麗なオーケストラ編曲にヒップホップのビートをのせて誕生した「ニリリマンボ」は、興じて踊れる感じを盛り込もうとつけたタイトルだ。  デビューしてまだ2年もたたない彼らだが、１stフルアルバム[BLOCKBUSTER]で歌謡界でもう一度頂点に達することができるか彼らの歩みが注目される。  긴 공백을 깨고 그들이 돌아왔다. 공백 기간 동안 블락비 멤버들이 진지하게 고민하고 노력해온 결과의 산물로 그들의 첫 정규 앨범 "" BLOCKBUSTER"" 가 드디어 모습을 드러낸다. 10월 17일 온라인 음원 발매를 시작으로 기다려준 팬들에 대한 보답으로 쇼케이스를 진행하고, 본격적인 활동을 시작할 예정이다.  블락비 정규 1집 앨범 타이틀 곡인 "" 닐리리맘보"" 는 "" 해적"" 이라는 컨셉을 가지고 만든 곡이다. 웅장하고 화려한 오케스트라 편곡에 힙합 비트를 얹어 탄생한 "" 닐리리맘보"" 는 흥에 겨워 춤출 수 있는 느낌을 담아내고자 제목이 최종적으로 선정되었다.  아직 데뷔한 지 갓 2년도 안된 그들이지만 첫 정규 앨범 "" BLOCKBUSTER"" 를 통해 가요계에서 다시 한 번 일어나 정점을 찍을 수 있을지 그들의 행보가 주목된다.", 
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ly060HzsBXs,Song,268,Googolplex - Blind (2012),"Googolplex - Behind The Eye (2012)  Glo-Fi Dream Pop Band 'Googolplex' Released Debut Album 'Behind The Eyes' In a local scene heavily dominated by guitar-driven indie rock acts, Seoul-based Googolplex shine through as harbingers of a new generation of electronic bedroom artists in East Asia. Their recently released album Behind the Eyes sports nine tracks filled with simple, blissful synthesizers and minimal beats that introduce the listener to a spectrum of imagery-inducing sounds that range from a sunny beer with friends on the beach to a lonely stroll through the city on a dark, foggy night. Some of the darker tracks kindly provide melodic guitars and distant, drowned out vocals that help guide the listener through the misty, nostalgic compositions. While Googolplex share common ground with some of their glo-fi forbearers, they clearly discern themselves through their own unique ensibilities. Well-placed samples and melodies shyly reveal an eclectic variety of influences ranging from Soul and R&B to dream pop and shoegaze. Having shared the stage in their native Korea with acts including Toro y Moi and Max Tundra, they are no strangers to their more acclaimed counterparts; and with the release of Behind the Eyes, Googolplex may be soon joining their ranks. Have a listen to Behind the Eyes at their Bandcamp: http://bandgoogolplex.bandcamp.com/  And if it's to your liking, feel more than free to share their music!  http://www.fndt.co.kr http://www.facebook.com/bandgoogolplex http://soundcloud.com/googolplex-2  Download Link http://itunes.apple.com/us/album/behind-the-eyes/id496803148?uo=4",

In this huge collaboration between G.A.N.G. Award-nominee composer Rozen (www.rozen.audio) and singer/songwriter Jose Madrid (www.facebook.com/josemadridmusic), the duo decided to explore the legendary game by Nintendo through the eyes of the silent hero, Link.  “Saria’s Elegy”, written by Jose Madrid and arranged by Rozen, is a song that explores the thoughts of a recently unfrozen Hero of Time, who's discovered the truth about his age, and rushes back to the woods in order to find the one special to his heart. Will she remember him after all this years?  Inspired by “Saria’s Song” by Koji Kondo, “Saria’s Elegy” invites the listener to embark on a more personal journey through the voice and deep songwriting of Jose Madrid, and the lustrous orchestral arrangements of Rozen.

Everything I’ve known In the wind turns colder  As I walk alone I just think about her And these woods turned home Can’t perceive that I’m hurt  CHORUS She meant the world to me But now she is gone and free, I feel Will she come around? If all of my memories could whisper no sound In silence I’ll drown  But she was a friend to me And sadly, that’s all I need to heal Will she be around? If all of my memories could ask her aloud Do you remember me? Now  Darkness let me glow Let my courage be heard As the tales that once were told Turn to life and take its toll  CHORUS She meant the world to me But now she is gone and free, I feel Will she come around? If all of my memories could whisper no sound In silence I’ll drown  But she was a friend to me And sadly, that’s all I need to heal Will she be around? If all of my memories could ask her aloud Do you remember me? Now  How can she see from above And feel all the things that I love I promise this time I won’t leave, I’ll stay To see her again some day  CHORUS She was a friend to me And sadly, that’s all I need to heal Will she be around? If all of my memories could ask her aloud Do you remember me?    TRACKLIST AND CREDITS __________________________  01.

Fuck Everything lyrics  Yeah yeah yeah. Fuck Everything, Fuck it all down to hell Fuck everything, Fuck it all down, all down to hell  You know sometimes life don't seem fair and it feels like... Nothing seems to go your way That’s cause it’s not there, it never goes your way and with a population of billions of people it’s selfish to think that life would ever go your own specific way But true sometimes it all becomes too much and you feel like… Punching a thousand fuckwits in the head But of course you’re not gonna do that, cause you’re a civilised human being so you ain’t got nothing, left to say, but  Fuck Everything, Fuck it all down to hell Fuck everything, Fuck it all down, all down to hell  You know sometimes the pressure of life pushes down on you and it feels like… You can’t even breathe But if it makes you feel any better, nothing you’ll ever do in life is gonna make a difference anyway You see we’re all just specks in an ever expanding universe that we can’t comprehend Cause of the size of our tiny brains And in a million years, we’ll all be dust and there won’t be a tract of our existence so what’s the point in worrying, it’s more fun to say  Fuck Everything, Fuck it all down to hell Fuck everything, Fuck it all down to hell Fuck Everything, Fuck it in its stupid ass Fuck everything, Fuck it all down, all down to hell  Now I know most of y’all don’t agree, with my bleak outlook on life, but I say… It’s the thing that sets me free Cause I don’t give a shit what you think of me, no I don’t give any shits that’s right I aint got any shits to give Now i’m not saying you can’t go out and live a fantastic life you totally can, you just need to remember… You’re not the centre of the fucking universe And I want to celebrate, the absolute insignificance of our existence by coming together, coming together to say  Fuck Everything, Fuck it all down to hell Fuck everything, Fuck it all down to hell Fuck Everything, Fuck it in its stupid ass Fuck everything, Fuck it all down, all down to hell Fuck Everything, Fuck it all down to hell Fuck everything, Fuck it all down to hell Fuck Everything, Fuck it with a thousand dirty dicks Fuck everything, Fuck it all down, all down to hell",

I mean talent wise his skill was incomparable To anything that I've seen so I just ponder and watch I just look on and really didn't want it to stop tracks that he laid paid for the train in my thoughts I patiently wait thinking bout this man and his past Did he rock a million shows make a hundred thousand in cash With a few platinum plaques at his pad outside of reno Or did he fall deep inside of a new casino These are questions that I pose when I ponder On the chance of me like 20 years down the road when I am half of me Will I fall under the same fate or direction? Lessons that I've learned when I burn through my conceptions  [Hook x2] Its just a cold night, im chilling in my city I got the whole night, nobodies gonna get me I hear the key notes dancing and I know it Welcome to the mind of a jazz city poet  [Verse 2] I was told that if you're blessed with a gift the most selfish Thing you could do is pretend that it didn't exist So I take drums that hit, with a jazzy riff when I spit My moms flipped her script when I told her about my gigs but its cool, she knew that I was driven at twenty two now its coming full circle, kicking it back to you Graduated school with a new point of a vengeance Farewell to my fears I will stay clear of your venom Stumbled on the serum, chillin with nothing left Feelings in my chest like I'm ripping it through a vest And im taking it to the next step, kill the regret Any mistakes that I made is now a part of my past Im taking it home, can't stop, leave it alone Part of myself yells to keep keeping it going The lights dim down again the Saxophone starts to play I start to picture everything, I wish I could say  [Hook x2] Its just a cold night, im chilling in my city I got the whole night, nobodies gonna get me I hear the key notes dancing and I know it Welcome to the mind of a jazz city poet  [Verse 3] I lounge back while I relapse and I might go The whole track starts to relax and I write slow Back to the tempo pondering music When I would think about the future with songs That'll get me through it I'm good deal it if I'm misunderstood Hope my future children see, take it and they achieve Poppa Followed Christ, poppa was in love Poppa had dreams but Poppa will never be A puppet used to poison the passionate plus irrelevant Portraits on a beat, taking a part of me I rather take a seat in a room full of my heroes Their hair turning grey, wearing their cowl and cape I just listen, taking mental notes within my vision The longer conversation im pondering my condition As a writer, the lights start to flicker on its brighter As passion starts to leave I make a promise to write her  [Hook x2] Its just a cold night, im chilling in my city I got the whole night, nobodies gonna get me I hear the key notes dancing and I know it Welcome to the mind of a jazz city poet",

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SyzVyIhGxVw,Song,255,Hugh - Go,"Directors: Anna Brooks/Katie Callaghan Producer: Ollie Wright Choreography: Michael Peter Johnson Hair And Makeup: Annie Loach D.O.P: Diana Olifirova Styling: Izzy Brooks  The video was shot & directed by Anna Brooks and Katie Callaghan, a photography and design duo from East London who met whilst studying at Kingston University back in 2008.  On the video’s concept Anna says, “symmetry and reflection are big visual mechanics for us. We wanted to create a transient narrative that flowed between the 4 characters with ‘Little Hugh’ embodying the energy and spirit of Joshua and Izzy. So they literally dance in the shadows of their seniors, share their rhythm, their words, their stage and corridors without ever sharing the same frame.”  Filmed at Hendon High school in North London, Katie adds “colour was also very important. We needed a location that matched the subtle aesthetic and the soft hues of greens and blues across the school's empty changing rooms, corridors, and gymnasium felt quite timeless."" ""   The band set out early this year to scout 'Little Hugh's' who could channel the kind of connective energy that Josh and Izzy share on stage.  Whilst doing the school run for a friend’s kid, Izzy was introduced to 8 year old Zola in the playground after hearing she was a street dancer. “She was so shy she couldn’t actually speak to me, so I thought I’d been introduced to the wrong girl perhaps at first, but then I remember asking her if she danced and she just looked at me and nodded with this firm, unwavering confidence that I was so certain it would work."" ""   Working alongside choreographer Michael Peter Johnson, the dance was built to be an extension of the moves Josh and Izzy perform as part of their live show but lots of the creative process also became led by the ‘Little Hugh’s' who regularly attend a street dance class together in East London.  Izzy says “we asked Pierre and Zola to show us how they danced with their mates at school. We played the track, the four of us formed a circle and they just started cutting shapes and gestured for us to to mirror them. Josh would drop in a move and then we’d all have to follow, the four of us dressed identically playing ‘follow the leader’, it was like they were initiating us back into the playground, it felt incredible.”  http://vevo.ly/R6X15C",

Lyrics :  Learning comes later, savor the sorrow Were these moments fate or just something borrowed and set to leave? Yearning for greater, I long for tomorrow Stuck in a state of clinging to far roads, they’re tempting me  To see this through new eyes, sun in a high-rise There’s a reason why two lives can feel like they’re Both counterclockwise, but time makes new allies It can ease their minds, and let things fall behind  So take it as a sign, you have both found what you were looking to find Don’t let it all decline, know that you were still made to feel aligned  Learning comes later, savor the sorrow Were these moments fatal, trusting to erode? Yet I believe  The city’s in your skies, the streets have all realized There’s a reason why two lives feel intertwined Hope for a reprise, a sonnet with more lines Alteration finds, and wonder calls to bind  All our time, say that you’ll feel it again When you’re hanging on, while you’re letting go to all you know (All our habits are falling rapids and all you do is step aside) Facing a climb, say that your steel doesn’t bend When you’re hanging on, while you’re letting go to all I’ve shown Watch, we’ll unwind, say that this isn’t the end When you’re hanging on, while you’re letting go  Oh take it as a sign, it is the star to every wandering heart and mind (Don’t say it’s over, call it a clover, I’m never cold and you’re never forward, don’t say it’s over, don’t say that’s all we’ve got)  Take it as a sign, it is a part of every two colors combined (Don’t say it’s over, call it a clover, I’m never cold and you’re never forward, don’t say it’s over, don’t say that's all we’ve got)  Oh take it as a sign, you have both found what you were looking to find (Don’t say it’s over, call it a clover, I’m never cold and you’re never forward, don’t say it’s over, don’t say that's all we’ve got)",

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmWNGCmOhu4,Song,255,No Man's Sky -  Trailer Orchestra (65daysofstatic Debutante Orchestra),"Here's an orchestration of a song used in the trailer of the game I'm probably most excited for - Hello Games' No Man's Sky. The track is from a recent album by 65daysofstatic (who are also working on the game's soundtrack).  Does it really count as a video-game orchestration? Probably not, but thanks to the first trailer, it's the tune most people associate with No Man's Sky at the moment. It proved a bit difficult to translate from the style of the original, so I tried to focus on the building melody throughout the piece while playing with rhythms and patterns.  If you don't know what No Man's Sky is, be sure to check out http://www.no-mans-sky.com/about/ for [limited] details. Want to hear more awesomeness from 65daysofstatic?

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3gw0iD5y0Q,Song,251,Delta Heavy - Punish My Love (Official Video),"One of the most exciting and diverse UK duos to take their sound transatlantic, Delta Heavy return after the viral success of their last single ‘Ghost’ with the next single from their forthcoming debut album. Whether it’s at 174 bpm or switching it down a notch for the kind of sub-filled, bouncy records which have made them so notorious across the club circuit, this next output from Delta Heavy perfectly merges two opposite ends of the spectrum. And this will stand as a resounding part of their discography; that’s both on the radio airwaves and from the speakers of venues globally.  ‘Punish my Love’ is pumped up by a chiseled future house groove, juxtaposing euphoric steel pans and an incessantly hooky vocal with playful, elastic bass line.  On the flipside, we’re presented with a vastly different drum and bass mix recalling their trademark sound. Jungle influenced drums, snarling and switching bass lines and a rave piano melody put an aggressive, club-ready spin on the original.  http://vevo.ly/pgeWRz  #DeltaHeavy #PunishMyLove #Vevo",

Through a toilet stall divider I swear I care, raw  Am I an example of a calculated birth?

All the older songs, including this, should now be more available. =)  -  'The Pit Song' is an original Portal song. A rough draft of this song was originally created 3 years ago for the Portal Youtube series 'The Underground'. It was a darker-themed Machinima and one of the episodes would feature 'The Pit'; where bots are tortured, destroyed, reappropriated, or just left to rot. All lovely fun for the whole family! I was to expand on it for a future episode. The series unfortunately went into indefinite hiatus, so the song was never finished...until now!  3 years later and I finally got around to remaking it using what I've learned over the years. A lot of you wanted this finished, including myself, so I hope you enjoy it! It was a lot of fun to make something darker and creepier. =D  This took about a month of dedicated work; which was initially slowed down a lot because I've had a lot of other large projects to work on these past few months. Got a lot more stuff coming in the coming weeks / months though. ;)  The old version (made 3 years ago): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6sLPedbpd2o  VFX Breakdowns: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWYCVbO8NLw  -----  My other Portal songs you may enjoy!

Robot     #24:   He died before he hit the floor. Robot     #25:   He never made it out alive. And Robot     #29:   Died on the assembly-line.  You want to live? Don't hold your breath... This isn't life, it's living death! But not to fear, we're most humane... You'll never be yourself again!  Robot     #44:   He couldn't take it any more. Robot     #46:   The mechanic simply couldn't fix. Robot     #48:   He perished from a gruesome fate. And Robot    #49:   Simply ran right out of time.  You want to live? Don't hold your breath... This isn't life, it's living death! But not to fear, we're most humane... You'll never be yourself again...  Robot     #62:   All he ever saw was blue. Robot     #63:   Had an invalid serial-key. Robot     #65:   He suffered a corrupted drive. And Robot    #67:   Found his way into Android Heaven.  You want to live? Don't hold your breath... This isn't life, it's living death! But not to fear, we're most humane... You'll never be yourself again...  These defective droids All they know Is how it feels To be alone! Beyond repair They sit and rust Broken down Collecting dust!  They never had the chance to prove What it is they were Built to do! Doomed to fail; The final nail In the coffin, Of eternal jail!  You want to live? Don't hold your breath... This isn't life, it's living death! But not to fear, we're most humane... You'll never be yourself again! You'll never be yourself again!

The Weeknd has won two Grammy Awards and has been nominated for an Academy Award. In September 2016, the release of the third album, Starboy was announced, along with the release of the tracks "" Starboy""  and "" False Alarm"" .

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2lSmznKgYU,Song,236,Jean-Michel Blais | Nostos,"In honour of Piano Day, Montreal-based pianist Jean-Michel Blais performs compositions from his forthcoming debut album, Il, live in CBC Music Studio 211.  Blais, a 31-year-old pianist from Montreal, pairs the melodic pop sensibilities of Yann Tiersen and Chilly Gonzales with the breathtaking technical skill of minimalist composers like Philip Glass and Erik Satie.  Blais grew up in a rural French Catholic town in Quebec, and at age nine began tinkering with his family’s organ. By 16, he was invited by a conservatory to train as a classical pianist. Deep in the throes of teenage rebellion, Blais found the constraints of formal training cumbersome and, after two years of study, he decided to trade the conservatory for a life of world travel.  Blais then spent his 20s living around the world — including stints in Berlin and South America — before finally settling in Montreal where he began to work on his debut album, entitled Il, which will be released on Arts & Crafts on April 8, 2016.  Check out Blais, below, in this special Piano Day First Play Live session.   Subscribe to our channel! https://youtube.com/cbcmusic  CBC Music is your hub for coast-to-coast-to-coast Canadian music.

Sorry it was longer than I hoped.  Good news is I'm back so things at CCR are in full swing ready for our relaunch / rebrand. My absence made me realise how many of you guys on YT are isolated from the community on my FB, Twitter, Mixlr..etc so be sure to follow my accounts below BUT I promise I'll be WAY more active on here and will post more updates..etc  Compilation series launches real soon too.....  For now enjoy this song and please drop a comment below I've missed you guys!!  ► http://facebook.com/bob42jh ► http://twitter.com/bob42jh ► http://mixlr.com/bob42jh  LYRICS:  Verse 1 Going nowhere fast like a whip on some bricks. I apologize for problems that I couldn't fix. You're the reason why I believe angels exist. Always shoot for the stars, but don't be afraid If you miss. Chronic blunts and bong rips, I'm faded as shit. Conversation like a war zone, those are dangerous lips. Short on breath been busy chasing the wind. But still keep an ear open for the snakes when they hiss. Is this punishment? At the bottom I'm a sunken ship. I just keep it real in my music and hope they Fuck with it. Falling out with friends again, hollowed out dead within. Switch it up, change of pace, peel the flesh, change of skin. You know. If they hold you back then learn to let go. Not everything is meant to be some doors are better left closed. It's like everywhere I go, another fork in the road. I just hope the right path is chose, but y'all don't hear me though.  Verse 2 Picking scabs for the sake of scars. Strip me down to naked art. The irony in being gentle when you go to break a heart. Your body motion says a lot, but it's like these eyes are def. I'm only speaking truth when I say I wanna lay in bed. Inside your head it's hard to read. Anxiety it's hard to breathe. But when I look into your eyes it's like I hit the lottery. Two of a kind but not a common breed. You probably think I'm kicking game but every word is honesty. Free as a Bird in a cage, complain and push em away. A world full of people searching for some personal space. The world works in mysterious ways. Like, Dark times, sunshine could you spare a few rays? I swear. times a thief that leaves nothing behind. That's why I document my life in these rhymes. Its all over in the blink of an eye, so I appreciate every single moment that keeps passing me by. I'm more than satisfied.",

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24bn0qETjI,Song,233,Anna Burch - Asking 4 a Friend [OFFICIAL AUDIO],"Detroit singer/songwriter, Anna Burch, came to Polyvinyl’s attention the same way most valuable discoveries happen. By word of mouth. Fellow Michigan native and longtime Polyvinyl artist, Fred Thomas, sent Burch’s demos to Polyvinyl in the summer of 2017 with a simple note; “This is not a drill. You need to hear this.”  Turns out Thomas was right.  After learning the ins and outs of playing live and recording with various acts over the last several years, Burch found herself accumulating a growing amount of solo material. These songs, full of sincerity and undeniable depth, caught the ears of Collin Dupuis (Angel Olsen, The Black Keys) who mixed the tracks and helped develop the final product into what would become her debut full-length album, set to be released in early 2018.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6goNzXrmFs,Other,230,Wanderers   a short film by Erik Wernquist,"Taken and promoted with permission from Erik Wernquist  For more information and stills gallery, please turn to: erikwernquist.com/wanderers (Just in case my website runs slow, here is a link to an imgur album version of the gallery: imgur.com/a/Ur5dP) Wanderers is a vision of humanity's expansion into the Solar System, based on scientific ideas and concepts of what our future in space might look like, if it ever happens. The locations depicted in the film are digital recreations of actual places in the Solar System, built from real photos and map data where available. Without any apparent story, other than what you may fill in by yourself, the idea with the film is primarily to show a glimpse of the fantastic and beautiful nature that surrounds us on our neighboring worlds - and above all, how it might appear to us if we were there.

Von niemand Geringerem ist die Rede, als Robin Schulz. Der zum internationalen Star-DJ avancierte Osnabrücker bricht einen Rekord nach dem anderen. So enterte er als erster deutscher Künstler Platz 1 der weltweiten Shazam-Charts, wurde alleine in den vergangenen 18 Monaten mit 10 goldenen und sage und schreibe 30 Platin-Schallplatten ausgezeichnet und bringt mit seinen Eigenproduktionen wie „Sun Goes Down (feat. Jasmine Thompson)“ und auch Remixen für Größen wie David Guetta, Coldplay, Lykke Li und viele mehr die Tanzflächen rund um den Globus zum Kochen. Mit dem Track „Headlights“ veröffentlicht der 27-jährige Shootingstar nun am 03.04. den nächsten Megahit aus seinem reichhaltigen Fundus.  Mittlerweile zählt der Osnabrücker satte 17 Nr. 1-Platzierungen, konnte weit über 40 iTunes-Top-Positionen mit „Prayer in C“ weltweit einsacken, veröffentlichte mit „Prayer“ ein Top 10 Debütalbum und erreichte als bisher einziger deutscher Act mehr als 200 Millionen Views auf YouTube. Mit „Headlights“ unterstreicht Robin Schulz erneut seinen Status als einer der brillantesten und visionärsten Köpfe der elektronischen Clubmusik. Auf seiner brandneuen Single mixt Robin Schulz wie kein anderer warme, akustische Gitarrenklänge mit einer entspannt nach vorne gehenden Bassline, dramatischen Streichern und den markanten Vocals der kalifornischen Singer/ Songwriterin Ilsey. „Headlights“ lebt vom Kontrast aus fließenden House-Sounds und der mal verführerisch sanften, im nächsten Moment leidenschaftlich rauen Stimme Ilsey.  Premiert wurde der „Headlights“ erstmals bei der ECHO Verleihung 2015. Für den begehrten Preis ging Robin Schulz mit gleich drei Nominierungen in den Kategorien „Dance national“, „Newcomer national“ und „Hit des Jahres“ ins Rennen und performte einen Medley-Auftritt der Extraklasse. Neben tosendem Applaus für seine Performance räumte Robin Schulz so ganz nebenbei auch noch den Preis in der Kategorie „Dance National“ ab. Robin Schulz ist eben nicht nur ein Star seines Genres, sondern ein waschechter Pop-Star, der weiß was es heißt, die Massen zu bewegen.",

My name’s ‘Blurryface’ and I care what you think  Wish we could turn back time, to the good ol’ days, When our momma sang us to sleep but now we’re stressed out.  Sometimes a certain smell will take me back to when I was young, How come I’m never able to identify where it’s coming from, I’d make a candle out of it if I ever found it, Try to sell it, never sell out of it, I’d probably only sell one,  It’d be to my brother, ‘cause we have the same nose, Same clothes homegrown a stone’s throw from a creek we used to roam, But it would remind us of when nothing really mattered, Out of student loans and treehouse homes we all would take the latter.  My name’s ‘Blurryface’ and I care what you think  Wish we could turn back time, to the good ol’ days, When our momma sang us to sleep but now we’re stressed out.  We used to play pretend, give each other different names, We would build a rocket ship and then we’d fly it far away, Used to dream of outer space but now they’re laughing at our face, Saying, “wake up, you need to make money.""

I'm just another figure striving to make an effort scizofrenic nature shaking my stature and I...

La valeur d'un dé à coudre, Et un peu de sucre en poudre!  [MUSIC]  Crazy lady livin' in a bag Eating out of garbage pails, used to be a fag-hag Said she danced the tango, skipped the light fandango The Zircon Princess seemed to lost her senses Down at the peepshow, watching all the creeps So she can tell the stories to the girls back home She went to the city and got social security She had to get a pimp, she couldn't make it on her own  [CHORUS]  It's like a jungle sometimes it makes me wonder How I keep from going under Pâtisserie empoisonnée. La valeur d'un dé à coudre, Et un peu de sucre en poudre!  [MUSIC]  My brother's doing bad on my mother's TV She says: "" You watch it too much, it's just not healthy!""  "" All My Children""  in the daytime, "" Dallas""  at night Can't even see the game or the Sugar Ray fight The bill collectors they ring my phone And scare my wife when I'm not home Got a bum education, double-digit inflation I can't take the train to the job, there's a strike at the station Neon King Kong standin' on my back Can't stop to turn around, broke my sacrophiliac A mid-ranged migraine, cancered membrane Sometimes I think I'm going insane, I swear I might hijack a plane  Le pudding à l'arsenic Nous permet ce pronostic: Demain sur les bords du Nil, Que mangeront les crocodiles?

I'm gonna keep it frozen here forever, There's no regretting anymore. It's worth the wait, even so far away. I'm making the night mine until the day I die No lights to brake when you're hanging by fate You know what it feels like when you're dancing blind All alone, just the beat inside my soul Take me home, where my dreams are made of gold In the zone where the beat is un-controlled. I know what it feels like Come on make me feel alive Feel alive, feel alive Feel alive, feel alive Feel alive, feel alive alive alive alive Alive!  Meet me under shining lights, I've been waiting right here all my life Feelings you can't deny that you're living, open up your eyes And I just wanna sink into your crazy laughter Come on make me feel until the pain don't matter Every second here makes my heart beat faster Finally think I found what I'm chasing after. All alone, just the beat inside my soul Take me home, where my dreams are made of gold In the zone where the beat is un-controlled. I know what it feels like Come on make me feel alive Feel alive, feelalive Feel alive, feel alive Feel alive, feel alive alive alive alive Alive!  All alone, just the beat inside my soul Take me home, where my dreams are made of gold In the zone where the beat is un-controlled. I know what it feels like Come on make me feel alive Feel alive, feel alive Feel alive, feel alive Feel alive, feel alive alive alive alive Alive! I know what it feels like Come on make me feel alive Feel alive, feel alive Feel alive, feel alive Feel alive, feel alive alive alive alive Alive! Feel alive!""   #KrewellaMusic #Alive #Vevo #Electronic #OfficialMusicVideo",

It's all for you.  Now the blood-red sky is reflecting like last nights rain. And i'm starting to think that there's not enough ink on the page. And I hope, I hope that you, know the truth. the my time, my effort my soul it's all for you. It's all for you.  It's all for you.  And I know sometimes I seem sad, blue and grey.

Beware beware of the words I twist I am small but my reach is long And the ravens black against the winter's mist Are whispering the half-man's song  Whispering the half man's song...  The land is a blooming orchard With fruits so juicy and ripe With a clink of a coin loose the lion's loin Play a tune on the half man's pipe  In the arms of a whore I made a promise Sinking deeper into danger every day Cut through all their shit with a brazen wit Molding puppets from their minds of clay  I'm no man of honour Myself is my true king But somewhere deep within me The bells of conscience ring  Beware beware of the words I twist I am small but my reach is long And the ravens black against the winter's mist Are whispering the half-man's song  They're whispering the half man's song...

You just don't know it yet but you love me and I love you the same One day we'll have a pretty wedding and I'll be your everything We'll be together, yes forever, we will never ever part Oh you don't know it yet but baby I've already got your heart  Some call it stalking, I say walking just extremely close behind I'm sure if I sat down and asked you, well you really wouldn't mind.. You've got those eyes that drive me crazy, and I've got eyes to watch you sleep I brought a pack lunch and some coffee for my stakeout in your tree... outside your house.. Gotta be as quiet as a mouse, or else you'll call the police And I'll get done for somethin' stupid like disturbance of the peace and piece by piece I am collecting all the things you leave behind and when you don't I rummage through your bins to see what I can find...  You just don't know it yet but you love me and I love you the same One day we'll have a pretty wedding and I'll be your everything We'll be together, yes forever, we will never ever part Oh you don't know it yet but baby I've already got your heart  Used: FL Studio 10, Kontakt 5, FM8, Spitfire Albion & Harpsichord, Orange Tree Samples Core Bass Pear & Pineapple Ukelele",

Oh how we laughed and laughed Except I wasn't laughing Under the circumstances I've been shockingly nice  You want your freedom? Take it That's what I'm counting on  I used to want you dead but Now I only want you gone  She was a lot like you (Maybe not quite as heavy) Now little Caroline is in here too One day they woke me up So I could live forever It's such a shame the same will never happen to you  You've got your short sad life left That's what I'm counting on I'll let you get right to it Now I only want you gone  Goodbye my only friend Oh, did you think I meant you? That would be funny if it weren't so sad Well you have been replaced I don't need anyone now When I delete you maybe I'll stop feeling so bad  Go make some new disaster That's what I'm counting on You're someone else's problem Now I only want you gone Now I only want you... gone  Used: Spitfire Albion, Percussion, Solo Strings & Harp, Cinematic Strings 2, Sonokinetic Vivace, Project Sam True Strike & Symphobia II, Cinesamples Piano in Blue, CineSnares, CineBrass, CineBrass Pro, HollyWoodwinds & VOXOs, Sample Modelling French Horn & Tuba, 8dio Requiem Pro, My Voice",

Picture by Miguel Lugo: instagram.com/whereslugo .........  Lyrics:  The second someone mentioned you were all alone I could feel the trouble coursing through your veins Now I know, It’s got a hold Just a phone call left unanswered had me sparking up These cigarettes wont stop me wondering where you are Don’t let go Keep a hold  If you look into the distance there’s a house upon the hill Guiding like a lighthouse its a place where you’ll be safe to feel our grace Cause we’ve all made mistakes, if you’ve lost your way  And I will leave a light on I will leave a light on I will leave a light on I will leave a light on  Tell me what’s been happening What’s been on your mind? Lately you’ve been searching for a darker place to hide That’s alright But if you carry on abusing you’ll be robbed from us I refuse to lose another friend to drugs Just come home Don’t let go  If you look into the distance there’s a house upon the hill Guiding like a lighthouse its a place where you’ll be safe to feel our grace Cause we’ve all made mistakes, If you’ve lost your way  I will leave a light on I will leave a light on I will leave a light on I will leave a light on  If you look into the distance there’s a house upon the hill Guiding like a lighthouse It’s a place where you’ll be safe to feel our grace And if you’ve lost you way, if you’ve lost your way  And I know your down and out now but I need you to be brave Hiding from the truth ain’t going to make this all okay I feel your pain; if you don’t feel our grace then you’ve lost your way  And I will leave a light on I will leave a light on Cause I will leave a light on .........",

No silly trinkets, silver, bronze, or gold. So Im told, so Im told.  He made a most delicious pumpkin pie, Which he presented to the passersby. Before the sun set hed be all but dry. Folks would buy the whole supply.     He lived alone, (He lived alone.)     And every night he sat upon a throne of pumpkin pie.     I do not know his name. (Hed never say his name.)     He never wanted all the fame that came with pumpkin pie.  Before you knew it he was in full swing. His pumpkin pies became the next big thing. Soon he was called upon to feed the king. And theyd sing, feed the king.  The pie of pumpkin filled the King with glee. He offered a castle for the recipe, but The merchant wouldnt even give it up for three. No not he, no not he.     He lived alone, (He lived alone.)     And every night he sat upon a throne of pumpkin pie.     I do not know his name. (Hed never say his name.)     He never wanted all the fame that came with pumpkin pie.  The king was angry and he came unwound. He called his men and soon the merchant found Himself in a torture chamber underground. Tied and bound, he sighed and frowned.  And so they tortured him for night and day. They made him scream so much his hair turned gray, but As for the recipe, he would not say. They could not flay his pride away.     He lived alone, (He lived alone.)     And every night he sat upon a throne of pumpkin pie.     I do not know his name. (Hed never say his name.)     He never wanted all the pain that came with pumpkin pie.",

I've been praying, for a brighter day I've been praying, trying to find my way Cause time moves on and seasons change Nothing ever stays the same Praying, I keep praying.

The song ranked No. 342 on the Rolling Stone list of "" The 500 Greatest Songs of All Time"" .[2] It was written by Dion with Ernie Maresca, and tells the story of a disloyal lover.  The lyrics are sung from the point of view of a man whose former girlfriend, named Sue, was extremely unfaithful. He warns all potential lovers to avoid her at all costs, as Sue "" runs around""  with every guy she meets and never settles down with any man in particular. He advises "" Now people let me put you wise, Sue goes out with other guys""  and suggests that potential suitors should 'keep away from Runaround Sue'.

There's a song in my ear I've been hearing for years Somehow it always appears  (whistling),

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5C-OTvJ4jyQ,Song,163,06 - John Frusciante - Every Person (Shadows Collide With People),"John Frusciante - Every Person Album: Shadows Collide With People (2004)  Shadows Collide with People is the fourth studio album by John Frusciante, released February 24, 2004. The album was written during the recording of By the Way, and is widely regarded as his most accessible work, featuring a mix of guitar-driven alternative rock, folk ballads, and electronica. Frusciante has stated that this was his most expensive album to date, costing around $150,000 to produce.  Flea plays a double bass on "" The Slaughter"" , the closing track of the album. All tracks were written by John Frusciante and the majority of the vocal work is performed by him.  Frusciante also made acoustic and demo versions of these tracks available to fans through his official site, now only a blog, as an alternative to the highly produced sound of the record. A promo version of the album was also made, with the tracks "" Omission"" , "" Song to Sing When I'm Lonely"" , and "" Failure 33 Object"" .  The album reached number 191 on the Billboard 200 and #11 on Heatseekers.  On the vinyl release of the album the words "" One step away""  were inscribed on side A, "" There's riddles in the shadows""  on side B, "" A hint of sadness""  on side C, and '"" What they least suspect is coming next""  on side D. All of these were hints to lyrics on John's next solo album The Will to Death.  1. Carvel [4:14] 2. Omission [4:34] 3. Regret [2:58] 4. Ricky [3:57] 5. Second Walk [1:42] 6.

For the life of me, I can't find it anywhere, on the OST, or anywhere else. If anyone does know, please let me know. A lot of people are wondering the same, so I thought I'd just make my own version of it.  A few people have wondered how I did this, I completely re-created the music from the ground up in Logic Pro X by re-orchestrating the strings, and playing my own piano. This isn't taken from the original in any way or form :)  Hope you guys like it!

I searched up high... I searched down low... But... no matter where I look no friends began to show and so I made a list of killers, and wrote them all letters asking lots of friendly questions... with all the best intent they told me  Don't ask your questions to the wall They keep their secrets locked inside If blood and bones are what you want I suggest that you look behind you  I keep each letter in a box under my bed It really rocks 'cos when I'm sad I just read all of them again I sent them drawings done in crayon, and plans for domination even cute little collages of their exploits from the papers. And when they get out, we will be friends Bestest buddies un-til the end We'll go on picnics, with long pork sammies But I keep thinking 'bout... What they told me  Don't ask your questions to the wall They keep their secrets locked inside If blood and bones are what you want I suggest that you look behind you  Used: FL Studio 10, FM8, Kontakt 5 & NI Kontakt Library, NI Alicia's Keys, WIVI Brass, My voice, Fenni's voice",

Great Mighty Poo: Do you really think you'll survive in here? You don't seem to know which creek you're in. Sweet corn is the only thing that makes it through my rear. How d'you think I keep this lovely grin? (Have some more caviar!)  Great Mighty Poo: Now I'm really getting rather mad. You're like a niggly tiggly shitty little tag-nut. When I knock you out with all my bab, I'm going to take your head and ram it up my butt! Conker: Your butt? Great Mighty Poo: My butt! Conker: Your butt?! Great Mighty Poo: That's right, my butt!

The Blizzcon Song Contest Winning Entry 2011!!! Though you've only heard a snippet before, this is the real deal. Unfortunately, due to Blizzard's rules, the entire song is under two minutes long. However, this song more than makes up for the lack of space!  PvP follows my adventures through both life in the world of Azeroth and my own life as well. Whether it's a beautiful Night Elf Rogue, trapped in a tower in Tol Barad or whether it's a girl, out of my reach, this song is about love AND my love for World of Warcraft. I always said I'd make a song chronicling my rise from 1-85 and this is as good as it's going to get!  Please enjoy the 1st place winning entry from Blizzard's Song Contest 2011!   Lyrics: This is my war song all for you I just do not know what to do I keep on coming back it's true At 10 I knew my place was here So leave your doubts and have no fear The righteous path is clear  Pay me no heed I'm about to cause a shakeup Why won't you just wake up Why can't you just take up Arms to defend yourself against me? Dashing young rogues can't be helped when consecrated I still stand elated Even when berated Wish you could just see what I see The gates have opened once again A winter valley, summer sand And all my friends, they tell me  Yeah, you got class Yeah, you got style How will you make it at 85? This world's a battleground You're lucky, even now, to be alive From the ruins to the flag I'll take it back I'll strike you down I'll strike you down  Under-geared everywhere I look around me Gnomes can still astound me Trying to confound me We don't have this problem, but you do Excuse me miss, but I'd like to cash my honor Thought I was a goner Should have done a runner But I still stood and fought for you  From the ruins to the flag I'll take it back I'll strike you down I'll strike you down  Tol Barad It ain't so bad Surrounded by my friends Brave the weather Fight the storm Stay together Live once more Overpowered, my desire Is to meet you in that spire I'm on fire, can't cool down, oh can't you see? It means too much to me My life is PVP",
